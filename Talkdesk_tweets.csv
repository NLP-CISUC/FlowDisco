1;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;135060;Any ideas?

3;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;135060;@AppleSupport please read the above.
4;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;@135060 Let’s investigate this together.
5;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;To start, can you tell us the software versions your iPhone and Apple Watch are running currently?
6;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;135060;@AppleSupport My iPhone is on 11.1.2, and my watch is on 4.1.
7;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;@135060 Thank you.
8;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;Have you tried restarting both devices since this started happening?
9;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;135060;@AppleSupport I’ve restarted both, also un-paired then re-paired the watch.
10;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;@135060 Got it.
11;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;When did you first notice that the two devices were not talking to each other.
12;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;Do the two devices communicate through other apps such as Messages?
13;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;135060;@AppleSupport Yes, everything seems fine, it’s just Health and activity.
14;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;@135060 Let’s move to DM and look into this a bit more.
15;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;When reaching out in DM, let us know when this first started happening please.
16;c35ce612-d246-4a9e-9714-f682397fecc3;AppleSupport;For example, did it start after an update or after installing a certain app?

63;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;258930;50% failure rate-not impressed.
64;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;258930;Glad I paid for fast shipping.
65;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;258930;@AmazonHelp @115821 Last month driver delivered box, sat in van for 10 min on phone, and drove off.
66;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;258930;"Then got notice that package was ""lost in transit""."
67;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;AmazonHelp;@258930 I'm sorry you only received two of the orders.
68;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;AmazonHelp;Is this happening with the same carrier each time?

71;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;258930;UPS is usually pretty good.
72;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;258930;@AmazonHelp Also, the item isn't lost.
73;12bb2706-089e-4483-b1cb-8e6118d92bdf;258930;I watched them deliver it.

182;7db8a733-43ec-48af-8a2f-7324c21b4788;213129;@USCellularCares Why not just let Samsung do a direct to consumer update if you aren't going to secure customers phones?
183;7db8a733-43ec-48af-8a2f-7324c21b4788;USCellularCares;@213129 Samsung has advised that there are no additional updates available.

400;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;Everything from the brown shoes on the left to the far right are girls.
401;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;Please explain why?

412;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;Because that’s what your advertising.
413;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;"It is sexism &amp; appalling of you to do this!"
414;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;"Boys require clothes &amp; choice just as much as girls!"
415;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;@Tesco It in no way is balanced!
416;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;Please provide me details to take this issue further?
417;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;I cannot believe your bias to girls over boys.
418;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;No explanation other than your wish for £££!
419;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;No thought to customers at all!

421;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;"@Tesco Hmm @Tesco claiming 1 choice of trainer &amp; boot for boys is balanced against over 10 choices of each for girls!"
422;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;How is that not discrimination and sexism?
423;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;Boys not allowed choice cause they’re boys?!

426;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;Tesco;I assure you this is not discriminating.
427;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;Tesco;There is just a much higher demand for female footwear than male footwear in our stores.

429;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;Tesco;@738870 Due to this big difference in demand we offer more female footwear as that is what our customers are more interested in investing in.

433;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;@Tesco You offer one pair to boys!
434;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;There was more choice in men’s then there was for boys!

436;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;You obviously do not care for children who are boys or you would sort this.
437;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;Nearly every mum in children’s clothing said the same.
438;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;@Tesco If you listened to your actual customers it would be amazing 17 mums there all agreed.
439;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;"4 were mums only if girls &amp; also thought it was unbelievable and you still haven’t provided me of details to take this further!"

441;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;You refuse to listen to your customers choices and are dictating to society what you think not giving us the option to choose for ourselves!
442;2616b245-3b24-42a1-8c2f-55b06c9da14e;738870;"Do you just buy the first &amp; only shoes you see or do you look at options?"

461;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;@British_Airways how long is it before you contact someone who's  taken my bag by mistake.
462;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;I've got a lost luggage ref number.
463;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;Got told today that a similar bag got left so that's who probably has mine.
464;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;I've got the majority of my clothes in it and want them back asap.
465;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;@804290 We're sorry, Dan.
466;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;If we delivered your bag to the carousel and someone else picked it up we're not responsible for contacting them on your behalf.
467;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;However, if there's been a bag left behind we'll do all we can to get in touch with that customer for them to retrieve it.

469;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;@British_Airways When I spoke to BA on the phone earlier they said there had been a bag left behind that is similar.
470;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;They said you can't return theirs until mine has been returned.
471;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;It's a bit annoying that you can't contact them and enquire if they have mine by mistake.
472;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;What are my options?
473;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;@804290 Hi Dan, I can appreciate your frustration.
474;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;Unfortunately, we're unable to do anything until your bag has been returned, as you already know.
475;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;You could contact the police and report your bag as stolen, or file a lost bag claim with your travel insurance company.

477;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;@British_Airways So people can just get off your flights and take whatever baggage they want?
478;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;great that is!!
479;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;You literally have to ring up one person and you won't, I'll not be using BA again in a hurry!
480;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;@804290 Hi Dan.
481;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;As soon as the passenger who has collected your bag gets back in touch with us, we'll have more information.
482;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;I'm sorry we're unable to assist further.

485;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;@804290 Hi Dan.
486;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;If another passenger has your bag, you wouldn't be able to make a claim with us.
487;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;You may be able to claim through your insurance so you may want to contact them.

489;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;@British_Airways So is there absolutely no possibility that you can contact the person who's bag was left and ask.
490;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;Obviously I would but you wouldn't be able to give me their details.
491;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;804290;I've got presents etc in the bag and no money to replace them now, so it's essentially ruined my Christmas.
492;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;@804290 We wouldn't be able to give you their details for data protection reasons, Dan.
493;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;We can't guarantee we can do anything, as your bag arrived on the carousel.
494;8e9ffa22-f9b7-4d6e-8294-cbebcddceede;British_Airways;However, please DM us your baggage ref, email and postal address.

559;1794a22c-a9e8-4c1a-bd35-b780ad46a9e5;459691;And they had me reset my overall settings, hoping it would fix the keyboard.

561;1794a22c-a9e8-4c1a-bd35-b780ad46a9e5;459691;@AppleSupport They recommended a hard reset.
562;1794a22c-a9e8-4c1a-bd35-b780ad46a9e5;459691;I’d rather not.

705;87435ae7-d8dd-4f92-986b-3fd5cdd28f59;226461;@MicrosoftHelps The other thing that triggers freezing and lagging is lots of comments.
706;87435ae7-d8dd-4f92-986b-3fd5cdd28f59;226461;And editors comment and query.

935;ea3ce773-46f3-49a7-99e5-c01beae260ef;GWRHelp;Nothing has been reported to suggest this service will be delayed - Josh
936;ea3ce773-46f3-49a7-99e5-c01beae260ef;120729;@GWRHelp Are these new trains - bought by 1st class ticket, but this is sub standard and completely unacceptable - feel cheated - disgraceful
937;ea3ce773-46f3-49a7-99e5-c01beae260ef;GWRHelp;@120729 Sorry you feel like this Simon.

940;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;Never flying @116450 or @AmericanAir ever again!
941;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;A normal 5 hour trip turned into 15 hours and having to spend an extra $400.
942;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;Unbelievable!
943;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;AmericanAir;@527814 We do our best to always get you to your destination on time and apologize for the extended travel time.

945;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;I had no choice but to pay $400...
946;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;@AmericanAir ...why do I have to pay for something that was your guy's fault?
947;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;Such a crazy amount for something that was because of your plane messing up
948;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;AmericanAir;@527814 If your tickets were in the same reservation, our team would rebook you at no added cost.
949;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;@AmericanAir The same flight reservation only leaves once a day from DFW-BOI.
950;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;I would've had to stay overnight in Dallas and miss an extra day.
951;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;@AmericanAir I needed to be in Boise that day so was forced to buy a connecting flight.
952;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;Ur flight delay/issues aren't something I should pay extra for.
953;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;AmericanAir;@527814 Our agents are certainly able to assist with any but we're unable to offer reimbursements for flights purchased on another airline.
954;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;@AmericanAir I purchased the connecting flight from AA tho.
955;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;I was told to pay the PHX - BOI AA flight was the only way to get to BOI that day.
956;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;So...??
957;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;527814;?
958;490f4442-3944-48ed-921f-de00097a9e5b;AmericanAir;@527814 We'd like to take a closer look into this for you.

1000;dfc62e23-5bb2-4299-9691-61cc8331745e;148014;On the delayed 15:41 BTM - Parkway, currently due into parkway 11 mins late at 16:03

1011;dfc62e23-5bb2-4299-9691-61cc8331745e;148014;At what point does this journey qualify for a refund (partial or otherwise)?

1477;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;124645;@O2 logic: new legislation means can use allowance abroad, something my contract charges me £5 a month for as part of contract 1/2
1478;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;O2;@124645 This was included in the tariff along with other services such as music streaming.
1479;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;O2;The price of your tariff cannot be changed.
1480;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;124645;@O2 My question is why I'm still paying it when it's now free by law?
1481;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;124645;Seems unfair to others that also on same tariff as myself.
1482;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;O2;@124645 The tariff agreed also included your minutes, texts, data and allowed you to have O2 Travel at no extra cost.
1483;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;124645;@O2 But it was advertised and sold as an extra £5 a month so £40 not £35.
1484;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;124645;So just wondering why I'm still paying it if this service is now free
1485;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;O2;"@124645 Your tariff charge is for UK minutes, UK texts &amp; UK data."
1486;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;O2;Can you send a screenshot or link to show us where you've seen this?
1487;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;124645;@O2 Hi O2 can I please have an email address to contact?
1488;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;124645;Fed up of dm-ing and missing calls as you always call back during work hours 😫
1489;76cc5686-77ea-45c7-ac90-50dfa2db1129;O2;@124645 😔 We don't have an email address for you to contact us Beki, what is this regarding?

1492;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;@SpotifyCares also, how do I import my iTunes smart playlist songs to Spotify?
1493;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;@141285 Hey there!
1494;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;You can try following the steps at https://t.co/jnWe28bxRW.
1495;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Let us know how it goes.
1496;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;On the other hand, we're afraid that local files will not appear under Your Library (Songs, Artists, Albums).
1497;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;@SpotifyCares please do.
1498;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;I've worked the past 10 years on creating those playlists in iTunes, and the whole purpose of migrating to Spotify is that it's social.
1499;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;So now I don't have any benefits of being a Spotify subscriber...
1500;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;@SpotifyCares is there really no workaround for this?
1501;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;I wouldn't mind putting some time into making this work, but Spotify just has so little use for me if this can't be done...
1502;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;@141285 We're afraid this isn't possible, but we can see how that'd be handy.
1503;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Your feedback has been noted.
1504;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Don't worry, once you've imported your iTunes tracks, you can easily move them to playlists by following the steps at https://t.co/a38Mc2DlCx /WP
1505;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;@SpotifyCares I think Im missing the point.
1506;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;That article doesn’t say anything about iTunes or how to move songs added through iTunes to playlists :-(
1507;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;@141285 Sorry about the confusion.
1508;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;The steps you're looking for are on the first link we provided.
1509;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Just head here: https://t.co/leBtTrQniD.
1510;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;@SpotifyCares yes I already did that before I asked my initial question (about importing smart playlists).
1511;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;@141285 We understand where you're coming from.
1512;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Currently, it won't be possible to do this.
1513;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Rest assured, we'll let our devs know this is something you'd like to see /DV
1514;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;@SpotifyCares okay, thanks.
1515;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;How do I cancel my subscription?
1516;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;141285;Is this possible each month, or is it per year?
1517;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;@141285 No problem.
1518;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Canceling the subscription can be done anytime.
1519;835df5d9-e956-4d91-9b57-0f6c8b137c84;SpotifyCares;Can you also let us know your account's username or email address?

1571;944d358e-50a8-4eda-be1f-82438f4d8902;278115;@ChipotleTweets I still want to know if that was a serious question if I ordered chips injitially haha
1572;944d358e-50a8-4eda-be1f-82438f4d8902;ChipotleTweets;@278115 You could definitely order it on its own...just checking.
1573;944d358e-50a8-4eda-be1f-82438f4d8902;ChipotleTweets;Let a manager know or contact us here: https://t.co/0f6pFdYU9j.

1575;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;@AmericanAir in Miami Airport...where do I start..I’ll never fly you guys again.
1576;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;Your supervisor is not customer focus.
1577;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;Your check in/Drop kiosk only has 2 people  with a line  of people while people in back relaxing.
1578;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;Then made me miss my flight.
1579;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;Not enough staff.
1580;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;I need answers!

1583;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;AmericanAir;Did you need assistance with rebooking?
1584;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;@AmericanAir It is to late because of American staffing and non having customer service skills I missed my connecting flight which cost me money!!!.
1585;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;I need to be reimbursed!
1586;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;Or compensated in some way or form.
1587;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;@AmericanAir American Express even called for me to have this situated and your reservation department could not handle it and said it had to be done in airport.

1591;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;AmericanAir;We're sorry your flight was missed, but we're unable to offer anything further.
1592;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;@AmericanAir Time wouldn’t be an issue if you had better customer oriented a staff and and enough staffing as @Delta does.
1593;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;I will never ever again fly with this company.
1594;6a921cda-4a5c-4395-a368-6d5ab7bc5e39;245717;Only reason why I got stuck with you guys is because my assistant thought I wanted a later flight rather than and early am

1705;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;@XboxSupport Nothing happening still.
1706;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;Any other ideas?
1707;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;I’m plugging it into the same hdmi port my S was plugged into
1708;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;XboxSupport;@254534 Are you using the HDMI cable that was included int he box with your console?

1710;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;@XboxSupport Yes
1711;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;XboxSupport;@254534 If you try using a different TV or HDMI cable does that help?

1713;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;@XboxSupport I tried a different hdmi cable with no luck.
1714;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;I can’t try a different tv til morning
1715;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;@XboxSupport I was able to connect to a non 4K non hdr tv and get a picture.
1716;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;It’s doing its updates now.
1717;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;Then I’ll try connecting it to the living room tv again.
1718;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;Could it be an issue with the tv already being set to 4K hdr and the Xbox not?
1719;d4158694-0021-4296-9018-71051d70a516;254534;@XboxSupport Was able to dumb down the settings on the old tv and get it going on the 4K.

1769;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;I ordered a laptop from a 3rd party seller.
1770;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;They sent the right kind of laptop but it's lacking features that was in the description: suppose to be a 2 n 1 laptop meaning it's suppose have a touchscreen and fold into a tablet.
1771;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;The laptop they sent (cont)
1772;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;@AmazonHelp (Cont) lacked those features.
1773;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;I tried contacting the seller, they didn't reply.
1774;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;I submitted a claim, they finally replied saying they would give me a refund after they sent this laptop back, which is no bueno.
1775;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;I'm currently a student taking online classes and I need (cont)
1776;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;@AmazonHelp (Cont) a computer of some kind, so going through all the steps of sending the laptop back, waiting for my refund to be available, and then ording a new laptop and waiting for it get here will take too much time.

1779;386e3bcd-66fd-4894-847b-f79d773ad255;131059;@AmazonHelp I think I can mange sending them this one back first and waiting for the correct one.

2214;649b9dec-6d9a-40c0-8f79-b414cd848938;228258;They're delish and a nice quick lunch for when I'm busy rushing around shopping!

2239;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;213284;@117153 I've downloaded the latest app (deleted and reinstalled) and the log in screen does not even appear in the app once loaded

2241;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;Can you let us know the exact device you're using as well as the operating system versions it's running?

2244;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;@213284 Could you send a screenshot of how exactly it appears from your end?

2246;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;213284;@SpotifyCares  https://t.co/hN0uZahKay
2247;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;213284;@SpotifyCares It takes ~5 minutes between pressing “Log In” and getting to that screen.
2248;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;213284;Then it holds there, with the video looping.
2249;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;213284;Reinstalled twice
2250;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;@213284 Hmm.
2251;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;Could you try removing the app again, restarting your device, then reinstalling?
2252;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;Also, does this happen on other devices?

2254;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;213284;@SpotifyCares I figured out a fix after this happening a few times: go back to main screen, press Log In again: correct screen loads
2255;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;213284;@SpotifyCares Literally, it's go back a page, go forward again.
2256;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;@213284 It's good to hear that you can log in now.
2257;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;Just to check, after logging out, does the same still happen when trying to log back in?

2264;5dac1e25-defc-4788-b40a-7a6725bf5565;SpotifyCares;@213284 Just to confirm, does this also happen on any other device you have?

2877;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;@NikeSupport where to submit bugs for recent #NRC app on AppleWatch #UX #Bug
2878;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;NikeSupport;@208606 You've come to the right place.
2879;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;NikeSupport;Could you elaborate on what you're experiencing?
2880;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;@NikeSupport Applies to current NRC App on latest Apple Watch.
2881;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;If you pause a run, the stop button should not be at the same location.
2882;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;Due to sweating,
2883;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;@NikeSupport it happens from time to time that I’ve to press the button twice, which stops my run today.
2884;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;As an alternative, the stop button could behave
2885;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;@NikeSupport As on the phone where you have to press it for 2secs
2886;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;@NikeSupport Other Point: Actions behind buttons like #pause and #stop run seems to run on the same thread which causes UI to freeze for some msec
2887;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;@NikeSupport Next point: Bluetooth headphones aren’t recognized every time, quick fix is to open another app and reopen NRC during the run, than BT works
2888;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;NikeSupport;@208606 Thanks for the feedback.

2895;803c0056-a6a5-4012-ae6b-d47aa1b384c7;208606;@NikeSupport The Bluetooth thing, okay.. maybe.. but both iPhone and Apple Watch are 2 days old with fresh install!

2906;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;@British_Airways Natalie I was 5min late.
2907;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;Plane wasn't expected to leave for 55min, airport was empty, pretty sure security would be too, (would guess the plane was too)I'm confident I could have made it to the gate with ample time, with just a tiny bit of your help.
2908;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;@223071 Hi Thamin, I'm afraid this isn't something we can offer any flexibility with.
2909;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;It's not possible to check in for a flight after check in closes, as the system doesn't allow it.
2910;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;Late arrivals can cause flight delays and we apply the same policy to everyone, not just when it's 1/2

2912;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;I can understand your disappointment, but it's your responsibility to arrive at the airport in good time and complete check in before it closes.

2914;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;@British_Airways Just for clarification 🤔- so you never allow anyone and have allowed in the past people that are late for checkin?
2915;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;Could you kindly direct me to this policy too please.
2916;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;@British_Airways And are you sure Beth that the system does not allow you to do late check-ins?
2917;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;@223071 We're sorry, Thamim.
2918;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;If you follow this link, it does advise you https://t.co/77ypcUvLtx.

2920;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;It is your responsibility to arrive at the airport with enough time.
2921;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;@British_Airways You've not answered all my questions - I take my responsibility for being 5min late, but your staff could have easily (assessed it's not busy and) check me in.
2922;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;@223071 We appreciate the points you've raised, Thamim.
2923;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;However, once check in has been closed, we're unable to reopen a passenger list.

2929;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;@British_Airways Thank you for the response- but it doesn't suffice and is unacceptable, you're flights are always delayed and customers get no compensation.
2930;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;You also make different exceptions for different people it seems
2931;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;@223071 EU compensation depends on the reason for a delay or cancellation, Thamim.
2932;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;Not all flights are eligible as not all reasons are under our control.
2933;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;We're sorry you remain disappointed, however, as previously advised it's your responsibility to make sure you arrive at the 1/2
2934;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;@223071 airport and check in, in time for your flight.

2938;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;@British_Airways Natalie - do me favour, let's quantify this: how long on average it takes to get from checkin desk to the furthest boarding gates at T5?
2939;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;223071;@British_Airways And for the record I wasn't asking you to hold a flight, the plane wasn't due to leave for 50min (and it was still delayed by 20min)
2940;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;@223071 Hi Thamin.
2941;22438f79-fe4c-471b-995e-3a247fd2fb64;British_Airways;It can depend on a lot of factors.

3131;9be0373f-c506-4a4c-af31-64deb5ae9b97;396544;If a buyer has an address the seller won't ship to, there should be no commitment to buy.
3132;9be0373f-c506-4a4c-af31-64deb5ae9b97;AskeBay;@396544 The seller does have the option to block PO boxes in their shipping options: https://t.co/enJDV5F614.
3133;9be0373f-c506-4a4c-af31-64deb5ae9b97;396544;@AskeBay You didn't get me.
3134;9be0373f-c506-4a4c-af31-64deb5ae9b97;396544;IF the seller blocks POs then the system should not COMMIT a PO buyer and lock him in a cannot-pay-loop.
3135;9be0373f-c506-4a4c-af31-64deb5ae9b97;396544;@AskeBay And while the seller is enjoying his weekend I get messages on my phone: https://t.co/9Tu3IzKW63
3136;9be0373f-c506-4a4c-af31-64deb5ae9b97;AskeBay;@396544 If the seller and buyer have info set up correctly, the sale should be blocked.
3137;9be0373f-c506-4a4c-af31-64deb5ae9b97;AskeBay;You can hide the transaction for now.

3153;d05ade61-54ea-4ce9-9d2d-22e76e796461;130367;Myself, partner and sister were booked onto the 20:59 to London Paddington

3159;d05ade61-54ea-4ce9-9d2d-22e76e796461;130367;@GWRHelp The main issue i have with this situation is that you guys moved the service to run from Shrub Hill and did not notify anyone prior
3160;d05ade61-54ea-4ce9-9d2d-22e76e796461;130367;@GWRHelp This is completely unacceptable.

3332;b0d80156-aae1-44e5-b0f1-9cecb7c8034e;337822;You shipped it to the wrong town twice, c'mon !
3333;b0d80156-aae1-44e5-b0f1-9cecb7c8034e;UPSHelp;@337822 If the shipper did not request a Saturday delivery and the package is in warehouse it will not move until the next business day.
3334;b0d80156-aae1-44e5-b0f1-9cecb7c8034e;337822;@UPSHelp Of course it didn't request that because the delivery was scheduled for Thursday and you sent it to the wrong address twice !

3944;7bc9a860-c06a-4f01-82cb-05f6f8d39a03;203476;It’s just that your app said that that train was delayed.

4062;e92a5c98-baa1-493f-aa8b-07cf4b9b28d6;321765;@Ask_Spectrum Correct.

4113;75eddfc7-8d88-47ff-8941-810c412447e5;736961;Or will it be stuck behind the 09:31?
4114;75eddfc7-8d88-47ff-8941-810c412447e5;nationalrailenq;@736961 This service is currently expected to arrive at 09:51.

4317;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;355176;@ArgosHelpers I have to pay £30 in a taxi to Leeds with a bike to get it replaced.

4319;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;ArgosHelpers;@355176 Hello Anton, I am sorry to hear your bike is faulty.
4320;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;ArgosHelpers;This is certainly not the quality of product we wish to provide to our customers...
4321;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;ArgosHelpers;@355176 ...As this is a store collection this does have to be returned to store.
4322;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;ArgosHelpers;I fully understand your frustration with having to return in a taxi
4323;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;ArgosHelpers;@355176 ... to the store.
4324;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;ArgosHelpers;For this to be rectified this can only be done in store.

4326;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;355176;@ArgosHelpers I get that.
4327;7d0dcb8e-2323-4315-9515-4055cea7fa5d;355176;It’s more frustrating that its more money to be spent on this when it could have been avoided simply by having a working product

4843;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;@Delta They did finally rebook.
4844;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;We were charged $75 per ticket.
4845;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;So $150.
4846;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;And I had to leave my $200 luggage at ticketing.
4847;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;@Delta Still dragging a trashbag of all my belongings.

4858;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;@Delta Sorry doesn’t help.
4859;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;A new luggage helps bc now I don’t have one.
4860;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;353791;A credit back for the $150 rebooking fee helps.
4861;16c16c20-aa62-4f5c-8a62-ee0ab30d6d9b;Delta;@353791 Angela, regretfully, as the charges show to be accurate, I cannot offer a refund or new luggage.

4876;026c9af8-c8ad-41f6-92ac-19cdf0cfafd8;338551;The pic hasn't changed on your end?
4877;026c9af8-c8ad-41f6-92ac-19cdf0cfafd8;338551;So that means what?
4878;026c9af8-c8ad-41f6-92ac-19cdf0cfafd8;338551;Is it really hard to add last years and this years?
4879;026c9af8-c8ad-41f6-92ac-19cdf0cfafd8;hulu_support;@338551 Thanks for clarifying!
4880;026c9af8-c8ad-41f6-92ac-19cdf0cfafd8;hulu_support;We have the image for Heroes Healers Hustlers because it's streaming on Hulu with Live TV.

4882;026c9af8-c8ad-41f6-92ac-19cdf0cfafd8;hulu_support;@338551 Generally we show the thumbnail of the most current season we offer on Hulu.

5234;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;341675;@AppleSupport The restrictive wi-if at work was choking our progress.
5235;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;341675;Now I need to get playlists to sync on my work iPhone.
5236;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;AppleSupport;@341675 That's wonderful news!
5237;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;AppleSupport;Were you able to sync the rest of your Music?
5238;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;341675;@AppleSupport On my personal phone, yes.
5239;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;341675;Still no playlists on my work phone.
5240;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;341675;May try factory reset on that one as well.
5241;2284846f-aa67-4148-b5ca-3e499c4aa9df;341675;Seems to have been the solution.

5273;e7636bda-9f13-449a-9b49-a5668628d3f5;324594;I dont watch it only from my phone.

5298;40497e01-1482-4bb7-8b77-efb9517fad6b;AzureSupport;@740559 We’re looking into your question and will have an update for you shortly.

5364;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;@GWRHelp I can't as I am away this weekend.
5365;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;I'll try on another phone I guess
5366;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;@GWRHelp No it now shows this - dates I want greyed out!!!
5367;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;I don't have any access to a computer.
5368;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;I just want the tickets I had in my basket :( https://t.co/nVW2qbRt5a
5369;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;GWRHelp;"@228227 This is because advance tickets aren't available yet for these dates:
Saturday services are open until Saturday 30 December
Sunday services are open until Sunday 31 December
Weekday services are open until Friday 9 February"
5370;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;GWRHelp;@228227 I would advise keeping an eye on our website here: https://t.co/4BYUNd7mJY.
5371;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;@GWRHelp Oh great!
5372;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;Thanks for letting me know, so annoying then that the site went to let me buy them - if it had said this sooner it would have saved me the hassle + stress!
5373;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;What date will they go on sale then?
5374;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;GWRHelp;@228227 We don't have an estimated date as to when they will go on sale, we do refresh the advance fares every Friday so I would advise keeping an eye on the website.

5376;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;@GWRHelp Ok - 1 last question.
5377;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;This paragraph makes it sound like they should be on sale?
5378;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;228227;I might be reading it wrong but thought I would check... https://t.co/93nURssU1u
5379;07403c57-4ff5-46c6-9a65-fca7d8c32779;GWRHelp;@228227 That isn't for advance fares, apologies for the confusion.

5392;b69fc007-65e5-44a2-a3ed-b36ffbf558f1;793338;It only happens when the WiFi is off
5393;b69fc007-65e5-44a2-a3ed-b36ffbf558f1;AppleSupport;@793338 Do any other applications have problems using the cellular connection?

5396;b69fc007-65e5-44a2-a3ed-b36ffbf558f1;AppleSupport;@793338 This may be why it does not play off of Wi-Fi.

5489;1ea9609b-9bcf-45d3-9c16-8cde7494443b;253034;Maybe you could do it too.

5763;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;@British_Airways left my laptop on the flight down from Edinburgh.
5764;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Your new lost property procedures are a shambles.
5765;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Nobody knows what to do and to have to wait 24 hours is shocking.

5767;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Shocking
5768;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;British_Airways;@655671 Hi Craig, anything left on board that's found, is handed in to Lost Property at the airport.
5769;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;British_Airways;It can take over 24 hours to be logged 1/2
5770;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;@British_Airways I was a domestic flight so no security issues so why can’t it be sent directly from the aircraft to the lost property section which in 25 meters as the crow flys from where we disembarked.
5771;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;I’m flying back now so a wasted day as NO presentation.
5772;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;My fault but this new system is .
5773;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;@British_Airways I was also sent from person to person as the new rules are confusing as well as being on hold for 1 hour at the baggage office.
5774;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;In the end I drive back to LHR to try and retrieve it but with NO luck
5775;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;British_Airways;@655671 We're sorry this has caused you problems today, Craig.
5776;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;British_Airways;Unfortunately it's not always as simple as sending the item to lost property.
5777;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;British_Airways;It 1/2
5778;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;British_Airways;@655671 has to be located and logged before we can reunite it with the passenger.
5779;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;British_Airways;You will need to continue to contact the airport directly.

5781;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;@British_Airways A teddy bear I understand but a laptop off a domestic flight in the club Europe cabin and a return flight the same day needs a quicker processing time.
5782;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Also to wait 1 hour on the phone and then they hang up is shocking.
5783;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Not a good switch BA.

5789;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;@British_Airways I now have my laptop back but it cost me a total of £40 to have it sent back to Edinburgh.
5790;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Then Another £28 to call the number your advisor told me to call to report it.
5791;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Why not give out the low rate number.
5792;58e48529-b402-4916-966d-4cafbb61e929;655671;Shocking, especially when they didn’t even speak when I got through.

5996;0b267922-806c-4199-8c8d-4a02bcf603dc;188414;It seems the agents need some training on booking Reduced Mileage awards!

6073;24a05cb0-36ca-4b29-b6ef-04dd97555515;267937;@Delta Why no other airlines plays seat lottery and screws with ff passengers
6074;24a05cb0-36ca-4b29-b6ef-04dd97555515;267937;@Delta I am ready to leave I am getting tired of no seat crap
6075;24a05cb0-36ca-4b29-b6ef-04dd97555515;Delta;@267937 Unfortunately, booking 3 hours before a flight departs, you will have this problem.
6076;24a05cb0-36ca-4b29-b6ef-04dd97555515;Delta;For security reasons, the airport has to take control of the flight, that close to departure, and seats and upgrades will need to be processed by the Gate Agent.

6083;24a05cb0-36ca-4b29-b6ef-04dd97555515;Delta;@267937 Unfortunately, that's our company's operational and security policy, and our airport employees have to take control of the flights in the timeframes that your encountering.

6129;9583b185-07e7-4ae2-a2c7-07e2140ac05d;272258;@JetBlue Because there are tickets available to get to my destination if  @jetblue would upgrade.
6130;9583b185-07e7-4ae2-a2c7-07e2140ac05d;272258;Thanks for nothing
6131;9583b185-07e7-4ae2-a2c7-07e2140ac05d;JetBlue;@272258 When you say upgrade, do you mean that you'd like to be rebooked onto a different JetBlue flight?
6132;9583b185-07e7-4ae2-a2c7-07e2140ac05d;272258;@JetBlue When I say upgrade I mean that there were seats available to my final destination but @jetblue would not upgrade to business class so I could go see my sick mother!
6133;9583b185-07e7-4ae2-a2c7-07e2140ac05d;272258;So I get to spend all day in the airport tomorrow.

6135;9583b185-07e7-4ae2-a2c7-07e2140ac05d;JetBlue;@272258 You can only be rebooked in the same fare class.

6169;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;@Tesco I need to do an grocery online order is there a maximum number of an individual item I can order?
6170;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;I need lots of flour and shaving foam for a show I’m working on
6171;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;@280379 Hi Ruth, thanks for getting in touch.
6172;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;This is a hard question to answer as certain items in-store have a bulk buy limit and others don't.
6173;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;"With regards to Flour &amp; Shaving Foam I can't see why we would have a limit on these."
6174;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;1/2
6175;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;"@280379 When ordering you can add ""Picker Notes"" so my colleagues in store can substitute you with an alternative should there not be enough of the item you have requested."
6176;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;I hope this helps.
6177;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;TY - Chris
6178;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;@Tesco That’s great I never knew about picker notes!
6179;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;It wouldn’t matter what sort of flour so I could add that.
6180;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;I knew some items were restricted to stop bulk buying but didn’t know what was included
6181;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;@280379 Hi Ruth, the problem with something like this is not just the weight restrictions that come into play but also we need to ensure that all stock isn't going to just one customer.
6182;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;So they've got to consider in-store customers as well 1/3
6183;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;@280379 Would you mind sending me a DM with your postcode, quantities and which ones you were after please?
6184;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;I'll then check which store serves you to see if they can meet a large amount on a delivery 2/3
6185;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;@280379 It's possible that it may require you to go in to the store and make a customer order to have the items ordered in specifically for you.
6186;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;What day were you planning on making the order for please?
6187;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;Tesco;- David 3/3 https://t.co/py5Z991Bme
6188;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;@Tesco I’ll probably place order today for delivery Monday of next week if I get the amount I need there will probably be s couple more orders if same items until 6th January.
6189;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;If I do an order in store can that still be delivered?
6190;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;@Tesco Will do’
6191;b13f8feb-dd49-4e36-a40d-1e0c88ab350e;280379;@Tesco I think I’ve just sent a Dm I’m not good with tech!

6194;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;VirginTrains;@231524 Oh no, sorry to hear this.
6195;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;VirginTrains;Please report your item lost by contacting our lost property team on 03331 031 031 option 1, 3 ^JH
6196;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;231524;@VirginTrains Have continually tried but just gives a number for kings cross which never answers and the web page just tells you what lost property is 😡
6197;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;VirginTrains;@231524 It would be handed into Edinburgh if found then they would call you back, Debbie ^MW
6198;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;231524;@VirginTrains Why would it be handed into Edinburgh?
6199;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;231524;According to your web page it would be the station it terminated at which was london
6200;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;231524;@VirginTrains How would they know my number??
6201;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;231524;?
6202;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;VirginTrains;@231524 Oh apologies, I read it as you were travelling to Edinburgh.
6203;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;VirginTrains;It would terminate at Euston so you would need to leave a message with lost property and they would call you back if found ^MW
6204;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;231524;@VirginTrains Well the train said it terminated at kings cross not euston, if you’ve ever tried to contact LP u can’t leave msge
6205;74b5cba1-d798-4bcf-8ab7-6ea3a7d475b3;VirginTrains;@231524 I see, maybe @120576 can assist with this issue?

6207;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;@O2 trying to upgrade as suggested by your app that I can.
6208;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;However, you don't seem to want or value my custom.
6209;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;Any comments?
6210;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;O2;@433871 🤔 Can you DM us a screenshot of what the app shows Steven?

6213;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;@O2 2/2 a bit more fight for my custom
6214;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;@O2 App shows the new refresh offer.
6215;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;I understand I may not be eligible for some packages for a few weeks but given the competition I'd expect 1
6216;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;O2;@433871 What's happening exactly when you try and upgrade Steven?
6217;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;O2;Which phone did you have in mind?
6218;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;@O2 Just trying to upgrade via your live chat where your 'advisors' seem to be encouraging me to switch to a competitor as 'they can't offer 1/2
6219;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;@O2 2/2 The same deal as a third party provider' I mean it's fair enough if that's what you want but it's a bit of a nonsense.
6220;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;Oh and Samsung s8
6221;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;O2;@433871 Ah okay, we're unable to price match another company.
6222;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;O2;However, we'd always offer you the best we can at the time of upgrading.
6223;95879bbb-afe6-42e7-95ce-5c4cf0f32482;433871;@O2 I look forward to it!

6672;39c77afe-248c-48eb-b35b-414be135707e;483122;@nationalrailenq Never fails to amaze me how abysmal your system for reporting delays is.
6673;39c77afe-248c-48eb-b35b-414be135707e;483122;Here we are at 6.32 and it's announced as delayed.

6676;39c77afe-248c-48eb-b35b-414be135707e;nationalrailenq;Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
6677;39c77afe-248c-48eb-b35b-414be135707e;483122;@nationalrailenq That doesn't change the fact that it was showing as on time until 1 minute before it was due.
6678;39c77afe-248c-48eb-b35b-414be135707e;483122;Why so late to let people know?
6679;39c77afe-248c-48eb-b35b-414be135707e;nationalrailenq;@483122 Unfortunately we were only made aware of the issue just after the train departed from Chesterfield, further information can (1)

6686;a77ba248-efad-44ea-8ac7-68f049526a60;639204;@GWRHelp 14.54 the train was on time until the extra carriage silliness.

6948;d3ec3717-b95b-4655-b386-9a4f4ccf1b41;UPSHelp;@422109 Customs is a government process that UPS has no control over.

6982;d3ec3717-b95b-4655-b386-9a4f4ccf1b41;422109;Now the package can move without being scanned?

6984;d3ec3717-b95b-4655-b386-9a4f4ccf1b41;422109;An absolute joke.

6986;d3ec3717-b95b-4655-b386-9a4f4ccf1b41;UPSHelp;@422109 I show that this package has been requested to be held for pickup.

6989;d3ec3717-b95b-4655-b386-9a4f4ccf1b41;422109;@UPSHelp Yes because for some reason the driver thought a signature was required, even though the shipper did not request that.
6990;d3ec3717-b95b-4655-b386-9a4f4ccf1b41;422109;So I’ll go pick it up myself since you’re not capable of delivering it.

7073;256556c2-ccc7-4701-8320-314ddb19757c;VirginTrains;@457929 The quiet coach is hard to strictly enforce but staff would ask passengers to keep noise levels to a minimum ^CB

7192;15634af1-14d2-4221-bb42-dcd553d932f8;MicrosoftHelps;Let us know so we can help you further.
7193;15634af1-14d2-4221-bb42-dcd553d932f8;276839;@MicrosoftHelps Getting no error message and no acknowledgement of the files on the SD card.
7194;15634af1-14d2-4221-bb42-dcd553d932f8;276839;Nothing at all happening.
7195;15634af1-14d2-4221-bb42-dcd553d932f8;276839;"This is only the Mobile version of Groove; the Desktop version is fine."
7196;15634af1-14d2-4221-bb42-dcd553d932f8;276839;I gather the issue is the library cache being gummed with old data and needs clearing (1/2)

7349;10e52e76-d8fd-4171-bf58-1711ba335d10;AskPlayStation;@463431 That is correct, if the region of the game is the same as the region in your account then the DLC will work.

7356;4ba4ff58-27d5-4e2a-86e6-fd8beab1d652;364212;@VirginTrains so I just paid £68 to board a train that had no seats ?
7357;4ba4ff58-27d5-4e2a-86e6-fd8beab1d652;364212;Surely this aint right
7358;4ba4ff58-27d5-4e2a-86e6-fd8beab1d652;VirginTrains;@364212 Oh no, did you have seats booked, Ricky?

7365;4ba4ff58-27d5-4e2a-86e6-fd8beab1d652;VirginTrains;@364212 If it was full you shouldn't have been able to book seats, Ricky ^MW

7450;46705ad2-704c-4c03-be02-7b033b15af5e;759300;is that like a voucher for another flight?
7451;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;631881;@115858 your last upgrade kills my battery.
7452;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;631881;Any fix for this?
7453;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;AppleSupport;@631881 We'd like to work with you.
7454;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;AppleSupport;May we ask which iPhone you're using and current iOS version you're on?

7457;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;631881;@AppleSupport Sorry, 11.03, not 11.1.
7458;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;AppleSupport;@631881 Thanks!
7459;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;AppleSupport;How long does the battery last from a full charge?
7460;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;631881;@AppleSupport Before upgrade I’d last the whole day unless I️ had crazy use.
7461;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;631881;Now?

7466;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;631881;@AppleSupport Thanks but I️ pretty much do all that already.
7467;6dd714a5-d2cf-4d42-a16a-bc71e0286b2e;631881;It’s entirely due to last upgrade.

7477;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;@Ask_Spectrum the cable and internet at our house has been out 6 times this week for hours each time.
7478;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;Rep said the hub is down and it's running on generator and service techs keep forgetting to fill it with gas.
7479;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;Neighbors have filled it twice.

7486;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;And don't ask for my info, I already sent it to you.

7491;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;Ask_Spectrum;@514083 My apologies, currently I am showing there is a known outage in your area.
7492;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;Ask_Spectrum;During our last conversation we did indicate that we saw some issues that we would not be able to resolve remotely and recommended a tech but we never received a response from you.
7493;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;Ask_Spectrum;^RT
7494;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;Ask_Spectrum;@514083 Unfortunately we are unable to schedule service visits during an area outage, but once the outage is resolved we would be happy to schedule an appointment so that you do not continue to have the same issue.

7496;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;@Ask_Spectrum awesome, so when the area outage ends sometime in 2018, then I can get a service tech to come out to my house.
7497;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;Until then just keep having no service but keep paying my bill.
7498;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;You guys are the best!!
7499;0bc357ad-4d6e-420f-b22b-992f7d7c0f14;514083;And by best I mean I wouldn't hire you to run a lemonade stand.

7507;bf8df8d1-357c-428b-b9a2-56d3924d36bc;VerizonSupport;Try a manual reboot.
7508;bf8df8d1-357c-428b-b9a2-56d3924d36bc;VerizonSupport;Do so by unplugging the router and unscrewing the coax cable.
7509;bf8df8d1-357c-428b-b9a2-56d3924d36bc;VerizonSupport;After 3mins, re-screw the coax cable and plug in the router.
7510;bf8df8d1-357c-428b-b9a2-56d3924d36bc;VerizonSupport;This should help!

7515;bf8df8d1-357c-428b-b9a2-56d3924d36bc;VerizonSupport;Do you have access to your battery backup unit?
7516;bf8df8d1-357c-428b-b9a2-56d3924d36bc;VerizonSupport;It is usually a black or white box with blue buttons mounted on a wall in a closet or garage.

7538;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;190327;Can barely hear Top Gun.. 😂😎
7539;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;VerizonSupport;@190327 Hi Rob, are you having a problem with sound on all channels or just this one?
7540;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;190327;@VerizonSupport Hi and thanks!
7541;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;190327;Just The Edge channel.
7542;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;190327;Mrs Doubtfire and Rush Hour 2 are fine.. lol
7543;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;VerizonSupport;@190327 Can you check and see if this is happening on all TV's or just this one?
7544;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;190327;@VerizonSupport Sure..

7546;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;190327;@VerizonSupport Yes all tvs just the Edge channel though.. strange.. thanks anyway!
7547;0887d3ad-cc9f-4e17-bed3-e2c134ef1bce;VerizonSupport;@190327 Disconnect the coax from the back of the box where it says FIOS TV IN, and then reconnect.

7552;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;@O2 hi.
7553;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;Any way anyone can tell me whether my iPhone X will be delivered on Friday and if not when I might expect it?
7554;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;O2;@123610 Hi Simon, did you pre-order online?
7555;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;O2;If so, it'll be delivered in the timescale showing when you pre-ordered.
7556;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;@O2 Yes I ordered online and I don’t remember there being any timescale shown apart from the launch date.
7557;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;I have DM you the order number
7558;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;@O2 Is there any way anyone can check for me?
7559;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;I’m guessing Fridays deliveries must have been allocated so can be checked?
7560;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;@O2 I’m guessing from the lack of response, no one knows
7561;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;O2;@123610 We've replied to your private message Simon.
7562;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;@O2 Yes but only telling me that once you’ve sent my phone you’ll then tell me you’ve sent it.
7563;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;123610;That’s not really what I was asking or particularly helpful.
7564;745a164b-a720-4562-bd43-c1377c2352b5;O2;@123610 That's all the information we have Simon.

7596;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;756759;@Tesco so arrived at cross point cafe at 15.14pm with my son to be told they were cleaning the hot drinks machine so couldn’t have one.
7597;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;756759;I bought a cold drink Then several other customers followed me who were told the cafe close at 15.30!!
7598;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;756759;Not according to the store opening time!
7599;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;Tesco;@756759 Hi Ann-Marie, thanks for getting in touch.
7600;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;Tesco;I'm really sorry you've had a negative experience in our store recently.
7601;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;Tesco;Could you please let me know what time the café sign says it closes?

7603;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;Tesco;@756759 Could you please also confirm for me the other customers were unable to purchase hot drinks at the time, too?

7605;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;756759;@Tesco Didn’t see any opening times in the cafe but checked online before we went to The and it’s stated 4pm.
7606;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;756759;We arrived at 15.15 bad yes the other customers wanted hot drinks.
7607;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;756759;@Tesco Also I think it must of been the chef that  put the shutters down on the fridge just after we bought our cold drinks so the customers after us didn’t even have that option either
7608;af364b86-367d-4484-b891-0582b5356515;756759;@Tesco I understand that cleaning down is necessary but 45 mins before the store was closing.

7709;250b9b16-e4da-4bb2-b2bd-1fa330a597a1;Tesco;@219473 Hi Andrew, when you were in store, did you ask any of my colleagues if any were available or on order?
7710;250b9b16-e4da-4bb2-b2bd-1fa330a597a1;Tesco;- Danny
7711;250b9b16-e4da-4bb2-b2bd-1fa330a597a1;219473;@Tesco I did ask and was told out of stock, but are you implying Tesco Express don't stock frozen peas?
7712;250b9b16-e4da-4bb2-b2bd-1fa330a597a1;219473;Won't bother looking in future.

7886;28f40189-9db1-4961-8b18-730ea3fcd3d1;282826;And the text for my delayed flight from Dallas to Detroit pissed me off!

7895;28f40189-9db1-4961-8b18-730ea3fcd3d1;282826;Sorta makes up for your baggage agents

7902;28f40189-9db1-4961-8b18-730ea3fcd3d1;SouthwestAir;@282826 Maintenance was on an earlier aircraft today, Sara.

7918;83a95a9b-85ed-405d-b908-d5d1c2a668fb;172951;@Ask_Spectrum The problem is that you only have 1 channel in HD.
7919;83a95a9b-85ed-405d-b908-d5d1c2a668fb;172951;If the game isn’t on that channel the picture quality is horrible.
7920;83a95a9b-85ed-405d-b908-d5d1c2a668fb;172951;Has nothing to do with the box it’s the fact that no HD channels come in horrible.
7921;83a95a9b-85ed-405d-b908-d5d1c2a668fb;Ask_Spectrum;@172951 I understand.
7922;83a95a9b-85ed-405d-b908-d5d1c2a668fb;Ask_Spectrum;Have you had a technician out to see why this happening the way it is?

7925;83a95a9b-85ed-405d-b908-d5d1c2a668fb;172951;@Ask_Spectrum That won’t solve anything unless the technician can make the channels turn into HD.
7926;83a95a9b-85ed-405d-b908-d5d1c2a668fb;Ask_Spectrum;@172951 If it is an HD channel, he will work to make sure it is coming in HD.

8617;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;520594;@LondonMidland Would lime st to London Euston be best bet?
8618;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;520594;I struggled to find details for your service online, do you have a list of stations?
8619;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;LondonMidland;@520594 you can go from Lime St.
8620;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;LondonMidland;There will be a change at Crewe or Stafford or you can go via Birmingham New St as long as it's with us!

8622;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;520594;Do we need to purchase tickets or can we just get on train and show our passes to conductor?
8623;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;LondonMidland;@520594 if they're our scratchcards just scratch of the number and month that relate to the date of travel and that is then your ticket
8624;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;520594;@LondonMidland Ok yes they are scratch cards.
8625;737fefd0-109a-4975-82cd-20d9b0c9bd8d;520594;So we can get straight on train then?

8738;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;Tesco;It looks like this is through an outward link.
8739;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;Tesco;As our direct site and stores are separate areas of the business with their own stock, promotions and prices can sometimes vary 1/2
8740;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;Tesco;@766089 Try having a look on our direct page.

8743;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;766089;Still looks like it is your offer.
8744;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;766089;Could confuse other simpletons like me 🙂
8745;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;Tesco;@766089 Hi Mark, I'm sorry regarding this situation, allow us to elaborate.
8746;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;Tesco;This is an offer we previously had as an online deal, as such some search engines will still contain cached results of our products and deals.
8747;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;Tesco;@766089 We therefore cannot be held responsible for any offers that aren't directly on our page as we have no control over cached versions of search results.
8748;c0882d0a-1d21-4caa-82e1-982b82d95d74;Tesco;Hope this makes sense, let us know if we can help further.

8768;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;No error message, I just press PLAY but nothing happens.
8769;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;I've tried it on other artists as well and I get the same issue
8770;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;SpotifyCares;@211169 Can you send over your device model/operating system and the Spotify version you're using?

8772;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;@SpotifyCares I'm using Windows 10 on a Toshiba Satellite Pro.
8773;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;Spotify version 1.0.65.320.gac7a8e02
8774;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;SpotifyCares;@211169 Just to confirm, are you using a public or private connection?
8775;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;SpotifyCares;Is it possible for you to restart your router?

8777;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;@SpotifyCares It happened both at work and at home, so both private networks.
8778;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;Just tried it on my Mac and it works - not sure it helps.

8783;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;When I try to play one specific song it says it's not available
8784;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;211169;@SpotifyCares Could it be because I activated the Premium trial and it just went back to the free version?
8785;4e8c42d3-36ff-4dbd-bdcf-0f2abb8b3997;SpotifyCares;@211169 You should still be able to play songs on-demand on the desktop app.

8807;d74ce77b-5bce-48b0-8bab-bbf2012142fa;Tesco;@327838 We like to get as much product onto the shop floor and we would view these as an individual food party deal.

8876;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;233806;@Tesco Seriously first world problem, but can you try and encourage stores not to refrigerate red wine provided with the finest meal deal?
8877;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;233806;@Tesco Verging on resorting to this... probably not wise 🍷 https://t.co/0iI1fMz2QM
8878;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;233806;@Tesco This may be better, but still not ideal https://t.co/iZvFcSP3LN
8879;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;233806;@Tesco Will settle for the “bath in sink full of hot water” option but if it wasn’t refrigerated then it could all be avoided 😬 https://t.co/7OiKjiYxDb
8880;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;233806;@Tesco (seriously though @Tesco can you do something 😢)
8881;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;Tesco;@233806 Hi Joseph, I can understand your frustration and you're not alone.
8882;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;Tesco;We need to display all of the Meal Deal options together.

8884;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;Tesco;@233806 Since the other items need to be chilled then so does the wine (for display purposes).
8885;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;Tesco;I hope it came up to room temp quickly.

8887;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;233806;@Tesco I understand 👍🏼 @marksandspencer have a separate area for wine — another option would be to include the meal deal wine with the normal wine?
8888;541f0b4d-8861-42bb-8836-974200eb09f5;Tesco;@233806 Could you please DM us your full name and e-mail?

8926;7409624d-aaa5-455b-83f9-606768471c13;116025;@AskeBay So, instead of telling me to contact the seller you guys should contact the seller.

9120;1d6afe59-2ca2-4023-8e4a-313e7a328af6;ArgosHelpers;@722748 Hey, if you pay online for Fast Track collection you will receive an FT number and PIN via text/email and that is all you will need to collect.
9121;1d6afe59-2ca2-4023-8e4a-313e7a328af6;ArgosHelpers;You will not need your card as proof.
9122;1d6afe59-2ca2-4023-8e4a-313e7a328af6;ArgosHelpers;I hope this helps.

9168;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;SpotifyCares;That doesn't sound good.
9169;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;SpotifyCares;Just to check, are you getting any error messages?

9175;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;SpotifyCares;While you're at it, what Android and Spotify versions are you using?

9177;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;352349;@SpotifyCares I have already restarted and logged out and it didn't work.
9178;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;352349;The android version is 7.1.1 and the app version is 8.4.22.857.

9180;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;SpotifyCares;Is this only happening via 3G/4G, or is it the same with WiFi?

9182;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;352349;@SpotifyCares It is the same with 4G and with wifi.

9184;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;SpotifyCares;Does restarting your connection help at all?

9188;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;352349;I tried it on my laptop and the songs are playing there.
9189;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;SpotifyCares;@352349 Thanks for the info.
9190;8b4d1bd5-ec2e-445b-ab47-84fb86acab33;SpotifyCares;Best thing to try here is a reinstall.

9514;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;We were transported to a hotel near Verona last night and told we would be collected this morning.

9516;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;@British_Airways Do you know what is happening today?
9517;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;What time will our flight leave and from where, please?
9518;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;Pain to go from Venice when we paid for Verona!

9523;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;@British_Airways Afraid not.
9524;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;We are at Verona airport again.
9525;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;Flight has just been delayed another hour with no explanation.
9526;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;No BA staff anywhere to be seen.
9527;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;@British_Airways The communication throughout this process has been non-existent.
9528;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;We understand that these things happen but no excuse for poor comms / mgmt
9529;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;@British_Airways And... the app is not updated, so having to use Google to try and figure out what is happening.
9530;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;192093;This is totally unacceptable.
9531;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;British_Airways;@192093 We quite agree, Jack.
9532;815626ce-51d3-4231-9a20-294551f49adb;British_Airways;We're in touch with the airport asking the managers to resolve the issue.

9563;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;NikeSupport;What device, operating system and version of the app are you using?
9564;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;@NikeSupport I phone 8 NRC version 5.9.0
9565;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;@NikeSupport Getting box of tissues just in case - my first time in years running 6 miles.
9566;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;NikeSupport;@166741 What specific iOS are you using?
9567;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;NikeSupport;Also, can you elaborate on what you experienced at the end of your run?
9568;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;@NikeSupport IOS 11.0.2  Started app, everything looked right, started running, got to where I knew I was .8 miles in and looked at app to check time
9569;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;@NikeSupport and it had stopped recording.
9570;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;At that point I used a medly of 4 letter words.
9571;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;Restarted, had trouble with it restarting.
9572;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;@NikeSupport Completely stopped and started a fresh run then it was fine.
9573;1a6b26a9-cf30-4562-b33b-ecafb59dcfc9;166741;@NikeSupport I know I did the full 6 miles, I just need the app to know so it can use it for my coaching.

9953;eaa84357-59e7-464f-8582-9af07c639a08;740998;I pay 10 euro each month.

10298;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;Why does @marksandspencer at Marylebone close BEFORE station closes.
10299;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;22 potential customers in 8 minutes.The delight on his face says it all https://t.co/N7BzJROGO6
10300;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;marksandspencer;@482662 Hi Rob.
10301;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;marksandspencer;We need to make sure we have enough time to get the store cleaned and sorted ready for the next day before the station closes!
10302;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;@marksandspencer True, but not related to when staff start turning customers away while others shop.
10303;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;What are official opening times of that store please?
10304;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;marksandspencer;@482662 The store shuts at 11pm.
10305;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;@marksandspencer and opens at?
10306;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;marksandspencer;@482662 7am Mon - Fri and 8am on Sat and Sun.
10307;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;@marksandspencer This needs to be reviewed, staff are trying to be helpful and open the doors later but leave customers with an inconsistent experience
10308;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;@marksandspencer Which destroys overall customer satisfaction.
10309;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;Far better to stay open later and be consistent so we can rely on @marksandspencer
10310;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;marksandspencer;@482662 We'll get your comments passed over to the store management team Rob.
10311;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;@marksandspencer Eight hours is much more time than needed to clean and sort a store that size, so there is room to improve.
10312;8c291a5c-def8-4364-a2e0-af9ecdce6db6;482662;@marksandspencer Thanks.

10358;5a55f0ca-4fa8-4898-b839-7cd98fabed0d;756065;I had to swap trains to Glasgow in Lancaster due to delay.
10359;5a55f0ca-4fa8-4898-b839-7cd98fabed0d;756065;Left my new blue scarf in overhead near luggage coach b.
10360;5a55f0ca-4fa8-4898-b839-7cd98fabed0d;756065;(15:53 Preston train) Heading to Glasgow 5 mins behind, can someone grab it for me please.

10365;5a55f0ca-4fa8-4898-b839-7cd98fabed0d;756065;(Closest to lower numbers) it’s a lighter blue thick wool scarf.

10551;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;Which version of Windows are you using?
10552;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;Please tell us more details about your concern.
10553;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;296265;@MicrosoftHelps Windows 10...Most recent update...Began around 10pm last night...Shutdown computer at 1am because I needed to sleep...Started up again at about 8am today...Finally got done (I hope) at 1:30pm this afternoon.
10554;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;296265;@MicrosoftHelps Just seems ridiculous that update should take this much time is my complaint.
10555;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;@296265 Thank you for your response.
10556;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;How fast updates install depends on various factors, such as your computer’s processing power, the speed of your Internet connection and the size of the update file.
10557;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;Should you need further assistance, please let us know.

10559;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;296265;@MicrosoftHelps I appreciate the response and understand fully...I have a brand new computer, fairly fast internet...It was, as far as I could tell, one file that was updated...Must have been one huge file to take well over 5 hours.
10560;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;@296265 Hi, Nani.
10561;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;Has the update finished?
10562;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;Just checking if you need further help.
10563;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;MicrosoftHelps;https://t.co/3qcAsLFkaY
10564;470cdbdc-0d45-458d-9580-674e3ad6fda3;296265;@MicrosoftHelps After near 10 hours, it did finish updating...Thank you for checking in with me...So far no issues with the current update
10565;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;@Tesco I have heard that you make a free from Christmas cake kit, will this be available in Kidderminster?
10566;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;(Please say yes!)
10567;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;@355045 Hi Rachel, I can let you know we ohhhh (drum roll) Do have this in our Kidderminster Superstore :)!
10568;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;Ty - Darren
10569;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;@Tesco Very exciting!
10570;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;Do you know where abouts I can find it?
10571;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;I couldn't see it this week when I looked.
10572;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;@355045 Hi Rachel, you should be able to find the kits on the right hand side of aisle 33.
10573;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;I hope this helps, Leah.
10574;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;@Tesco Brilliant!
10575;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;Thank you!
10576;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;My toddler is very much looking forward to baking!
10577;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;@Tesco I am in Tesco right now and the staff can't find it :(
10578;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;@355045 I am sorry Rachel.
10579;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;Have the store started stocking other Christmas related goods?
10580;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;Thanks - Lara.
10581;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;@Tesco Lots, all other free from Christmas items but no space for a free from Christmas cake kit :( Leah's tweet said it was in stock but it's not
10582;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;@355045 Hi Rachel, I'm so sorry.
10583;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;Are you referring to the Free From Vanilla Christmas jumper cake kit by any chance?
10584;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;- Kirsten
10585;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;@Tesco I was told you had a specific free from Christmas cake kit?
10586;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;355045;(Traditional fruit cake)
10587;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;@355045 Hi Rachel, we have the Free From Vanilla cake kit and Free From Chocolate Christmas Pudding kits available.
10588;46fcbfcd-6385-41ef-a609-c6717d9214d8;Tesco;Thanks - Ian
10589;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;@115714 The Moto Z2's are garbage and you know it.
10590;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;Why did you sell me two of them?!
10591;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;https://t.co/XHf7ivHviF
10592;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;sprintcare;@487676 @115714 Have we done any trouble shooting to fix the issue?
10593;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;@sprintcare @115714 Tried, yes.
10594;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;Succeeded, no.
10595;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;sprintcare;@487676 Have you done a factory reset or gotten new SIM cards?
10596;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;@sprintcare Haven't gotten new SIM cards.
10597;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;Are you eluding that 2 new SIMs are faulty?
10598;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;sprintcare;@487676 You've gone through trouble shooting steps and nothing have worked, try a new SIM card before the extreme of a factory reset.
10599;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;sprintcare;@487676 You've gone through trouble shooting steps and trying a new SIM card might help.
10600;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;@sprintcare I'm pretty sure it's the Moto Z2's.
10601;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;487676;They're an $800 paperweight.
10602;ce70d84e-8f8d-410e-be5a-4fb2001b9d7c;sprintcare;@487676 Let our repair reps take a look at it.
10603;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;@AppleSupport I’ve fully updated my phone and it is still freezing for 10 or so seconds when switching to and from the emoji keyboard.
10604;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;Anything I can do to fix this??
10605;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;?
10606;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;@247210 Thanks for reaching out, we're here to partner up with you and look for the best solution to your issue.
10607;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;Are you having this issue with your Messages app or a third party app to send/receive messages?
10608;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;@AppleSupport With iMessage, texting, in notes, with any social media apps, etc.
10609;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;It’s the keyboard that’s the issue because anywhere I try to do an emoji, the keyboard freezes.
10610;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;@247210 Thanks for letting us know.
10611;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;Have you tried restarting your device?
10612;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;If you did, does it temporarily resolve the issue before it comes back?
10613;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;@AppleSupport Yes I have.
10614;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;And no it doesn’t.
10615;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;It’s been an issue since the initial 11 update and nothing resolves it
10616;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;@247210 By any chance, are you experiencing a similar issue throughout the whole device or only when you attempt to use your keyboard?
10617;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;We want to make sure that we narrow down the issue between the keyboard or the overall system performance.
10618;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;@AppleSupport Well the whole device is wayyy slower than before, that’s for sure.
10619;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;BUT, specifically freezing happens primarily with the emoji keyboard.
10620;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;And only that one.
10621;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;247210;I have an Italian keyboard and there are no issues with that one.
10622;630bd096-9d0b-4435-b2d8-2b3e43ff44a2;AppleSupport;@247210 We appreciate the info that you've provided us so far.

10626;c631f0ed-3256-4a1d-be31-8c8f2b2ee22c;SpotifyCares;@556756 Hey, this doesn't sound good.
10627;c631f0ed-3256-4a1d-be31-8c8f2b2ee22c;SpotifyCares;Can you let us know the device/OS and Spotify version you're using?

10638;c631f0ed-3256-4a1d-be31-8c8f2b2ee22c;SpotifyCares;Can you try logging out of Spotify, restarting your device, and logging back in to see if that helps?

10649;1bad4d31-0924-4efd-95dc-bf1bf8585f6a;131551;@VirginTrains Hi, full train prices still don't seem to be out for the whole Christmas period - can you confirm when they'll be released?
10650;1bad4d31-0924-4efd-95dc-bf1bf8585f6a;VirginTrains;@131551 What date are you looking at Matt?

10654;1bad4d31-0924-4efd-95dc-bf1bf8585f6a;VirginTrains;The tickets for 27th will be released tomorrow and 28th will be released on 20/10.

10658;1bad4d31-0924-4efd-95dc-bf1bf8585f6a;131551;I'm checking now and prices are actually MORE expensive than they were ystrday 1/2
10659;1bad4d31-0924-4efd-95dc-bf1bf8585f6a;131551;@VirginTrains £83 as opposed to £80 2/2
10660;1bad4d31-0924-4efd-95dc-bf1bf8585f6a;VirginTrains;@131551 We were told today so hopefully in the next hour or so, Matt ^MW
10661;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;276841;@MicrosoftHelps I have a Surface Pro 4 i7 and my screen panel has started flickering up and down, bought in US Microsoft Store in Feb 2016 but I am now in UK how to get support
10662;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;@276841 Hi Russell.
10663;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;We got you covered.
10664;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;When did this issue start?
10665;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?
10666;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;What version and build of the operating system is running on your device?
10667;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;276841;@MicrosoftHelps about a month ago now,  I have downloaded the trouble shooter app and been through that (nothing found) - currently on Windows 10 v1703 (build 15063.726)
10668;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;276841;@MicrosoftHelps The issue appears to be related to heat as it does not happen if the machine has been off and starts once it has been on for an hour or two.
10669;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;276841;Currently working with external monitors mostly as the panel is just a blur of screen judder
10670;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;@276841 We appreciate your response.
10671;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;We suggest that you update your display adapter on the device manager by following the steps on this link: https://t.co/sH41IJGu3m Feel free to tweet us back if you need further assistance.
10672;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;276841;@MicrosoftHelps I have tried that and the Intel driver said it was not for my machine and refused to install - still got the same problem
10673;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;@276841 If updating the display adapter from the Device Manager doesn't work, you may also download the display driver here: https://t.co/tHZ69sPIwm
10674;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;@276841 Hi.
10675;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;We just wanted to follow up on your concern.

10677;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;276841;@MicrosoftHelps I am afraid that had no effect - installing the latest drivers as you suggested and still get the shuddering.
10678;c0467f68-fae8-4467-95af-bd839e23ede5;MicrosoftHelps;@276841 In this case, we suggest that you contact our Answer Desk for further assistance.

10687;bd602d47-dce2-4cde-a2c1-4605bb36190f;mediatemplehelp;@433738 I see, it looks like there was a support request sent out regarding the service being compromised, the sites we likely disabled as a result.
10688;bd602d47-dce2-4cde-a2c1-4605bb36190f;mediatemplehelp;@433738 I would suggest reviewing the file list provided in the notice and/or updating the open support request with any additional questions.
10689;bd602d47-dce2-4cde-a2c1-4605bb36190f;433738;@mediatemplehelp :\ None of the files are legitimate from what i can tell.
10690;bd602d47-dce2-4cde-a2c1-4605bb36190f;433738;Domains no longer registered are listed…
10691;bd602d47-dce2-4cde-a2c1-4605bb36190f;mediatemplehelp;@433738 I would suggest going through and removing/replacing the listed files, once cleaned we can rescan the sever and enable the sites.

11080;6ed4170f-d441-43ce-8877-b74b239baa7a;579189;Thanks
11081;6ed4170f-d441-43ce-8877-b74b239baa7a;ArgosHelpers;@579189 That's fine but Dyson do prefer to deal with their own after-sales care, so it may be a quicker and easier process to phone them.
11082;6ed4170f-d441-43ce-8877-b74b239baa7a;579189;@ArgosHelpers Oh ok, maybe I will do that.
11083;6ed4170f-d441-43ce-8877-b74b239baa7a;579189;Other manufacturers often try fix the problem even if its new but maybe Dyson will be different.

11397;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;DropboxSupport;@391961 Hi there, we’ll pass your suggestion onto our dev team.
11398;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;DropboxSupport;Just so you’re aware, Opera isn’t a supported browser for... 1/2
11399;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;DropboxSupport;@391961 ...Dropbox.com.
11400;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;DropboxSupport;You can see the supported browsers at the following page: https://t.co/dbZ6rlRtkS 2/2
11401;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;@DropboxSupport It's obvious Opera isn't supported.
11402;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;Don't hide behind this excuse, it's not the 90s anymore: 'best viewed in Netscape'.
11403;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;The prob != Opera…
11404;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;@DropboxSupport as U2F works perfectly with Google and Github in Opera.
11405;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;SMS is 2FA insecure, unreliable and cumbersome.
11406;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;It rarely works where I live.
11407;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;@DropboxSupport FYI simply changing user agent in Opera to Chrome allows U2F logins on Dropbox.
11408;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;This doesn't take months to add, or require special support.
11409;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;391961;@DropboxSupport And finally, Firefox _is_ a supported browser but U2F logins don't work on Dropbox, whereas they work on Github.
11410;f8d4cfae-d61f-49d8-848b-54fca4fbdf3c;DropboxSupport;@391961 Hi again, can you let us know which OS are you using?

11444;d08c2cee-7661-465f-944a-8b7d6bb35402;784386;@AmericanAir That would be great but the flight attendant confronted me and escalated a situtation which led me to being kicked off the plane.
11445;d08c2cee-7661-465f-944a-8b7d6bb35402;784386;@AmericanAir All I did was ask for an update, I have several passengers expressing the same.

11450;d08c2cee-7661-465f-944a-8b7d6bb35402;784386;But that's not te problem, it's the work ethic and horrible customer service which we experienced on the plane.

11590;74057045-ddb9-4b6e-a757-bf9395481d40;550692;@Delta And the flight attendant told her to quit complaining because it's only 1 child.

11997;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;Power Supply blinks orange and white.
11998;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;Bought new supply same thing.
11999;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;What now
12000;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;@246814 Hi there!
12001;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;Let's have you try the steps in the guide here: https://t.co/rhsLpNZvg8 to help resolve this issue.
12002;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;^JA
12003;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;@XboxSupport already tried that another support page says light blinking indicates power supply failure buy new one which I did but it new supply blinks
12004;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;@XboxSupport So is xbox cause of fault not the power supply
12005;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;@246814 Just to be sure, are you using a power strip with the console?

12007;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;@XboxSupport I was but tested without it also
12008;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;@246814 We would recommend never using a power strip or surge protector with the console as it will  1 ^JL

12010;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;Can you test a third power supply to be sure it is not the console?
12011;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;2 ^JL
12012;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;@XboxSupport I don't want to purchase a 3rd supply.
12013;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;What's the likely hood the xbox is killing the power supply?
12014;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;@246814 Are you able to test that at a local game store or at a friend's house?
12015;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;If you are  1 ^JL
12016;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;@246814 unable to or those steps do not work you can set up a repair using this link https://t.co/jXDLrAu4ZJ  2 ^JL
12017;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;246814;@XboxSupport What's a repair likely to cost as a maximum?
12018;64713c75-5d1f-418d-b61e-8bc79b42c1dc;XboxSupport;@246814 We would not be able to speculate on that as it would depend on warranty and  1 ^JL

12308;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;@VirginAtlantic We had reserved bulkhead both journeys and have not been given it however on the way out a family of 4 had bulkhead with 1 child.
12309;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;We were given no explanation just told to complain when got home.
12310;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;We paid for something we need and instead will be cramped for 8 hours now!

12316;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;@VirginAtlantic We were told they can’t be guaranteed as other children and disabled may need but a family had whole row with only 1 child.
12317;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;However as stated we PAID for 3 extra leg room seats which we have not been given!
12318;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;VirginAtlantic;@231726 The cost should be refunded to you.

12321;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;@VirginAtlantic So if I booked 1st class there’s a chance I could be seated in economy?
12322;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;Same difference Iv paid for extra leg room because we need it!
12323;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;231726;Surely you know how many extra leg room seats there are and how many have been purchased!
12324;5c3d4737-3bad-445d-8149-ad5bb3515961;VirginAtlantic;@231726 There's lots of different reasons seats in your cabin can change.

12992;500f284f-d6b8-4aaa-9839-2592ba64cb73;576987;Oh, except that is the law.
12993;500f284f-d6b8-4aaa-9839-2592ba64cb73;576987;And let’s not forget the 10% admin costs you kept - thats £3.4m https://t.co/7dvxLsMf9D
12994;500f284f-d6b8-4aaa-9839-2592ba64cb73;576987;@Tesco How much though?
12995;500f284f-d6b8-4aaa-9839-2592ba64cb73;576987;Law different for BfL compared to single use.
12996;500f284f-d6b8-4aaa-9839-2592ba64cb73;576987;So you will ultimately profit from this move.
12997;500f284f-d6b8-4aaa-9839-2592ba64cb73;576987;Yes?
12998;500f284f-d6b8-4aaa-9839-2592ba64cb73;576987;@Tesco But you’re now able to profit on the remaining 75% of sales.

13003;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;AmericanAir;Thanks for understanding.
13004;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;@AmericanAir surely you can have a better way to redeem them then to have to mail them in?

13006;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;@AmericanAir That's not exactly convenient.

13011;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;In Manila, postal service won't ship the voucher because it's considered money and no AA desk at NAIA...

13015;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;@AmericanAir Will they accept the voucher there?
13016;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;I already have a record locator
13017;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;@AmericanAir And those are my working hours...

13019;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;@AmericanAir Can I please get answers to my last questions?

13024;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;How is AA still in oneworld?
13025;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;165868;@AmericanAir Is there really no way to just have this processed via email?
13026;26df60d4-6e08-46c5-a706-f288763c55f9;AmericanAir;@165868 You'll need to bring the voucher in person in order to use it.

13274;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;Why are the Maldives not on this list as that is what @British_Airways states?

13276;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;@269039 Hi Michiel, the Maldives is included on the list here https://t.co/0Dxu1u0ZZw.
13277;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;@British_Airways So the government doesn’t require it but BA does?
13278;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;That is a BA list.
13279;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;The gov is authoritative source I would think.
13280;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;Also outbound your staff said no iPhone 7s which is smaller than the measurements.
13281;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;@269039 website, then you'll need to contact them directly.
13282;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;We are complying with the UK Governments new security requirements for cabin baggage.
13283;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;^C
13284;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;@British_Airways The link to DfT doesn’t have Maldives on there.
13285;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;Click on the link in your own website.
13286;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;@British_Airways You refer to the government on your website.
13287;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;I don’t need to contact them.
13288;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;You should as you are not in line with the DfT.
13289;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;@British_Airways Your staff at LGW told me it was a Maldives rule and I should familiarise myself with the law over there.
13290;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;I found it is a BA rule, not a UK DfT rule.
13291;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;@269039 Hi Michiel.
13292;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;We're sorry you remain unhappy.

13297;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;So show me the letter from DfT that says Maldives is on there.
13298;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;Have you checked the link you send me?
13299;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;@British_Airways Maldives not on DfT website.
13300;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;So you will be wholly responsible if anything happens.
13301;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;@British_Airways You didn’t inform people travelling or people there?
13302;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;When did the DfT add Maldives?

13306;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;@British_Airways Fine.
13307;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;Still Maldives not on the DfT website.
13308;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;269039;So, show me based on what you added Maldives to the list.
13309;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;@269039 We're waiting for further information on this matter, Michiel.

13312;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;@269039 Hi, we ask customers flying from the Maldives to comply with the additional security requirements and are unable to discuss 1/2
13313;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;@269039 matters of operational security, however, the safety of our customers is our top priroity.

13315;a70232cf-de9e-4dd3-afd5-5cc7a7019095;British_Airways;@269039 details about all the measures we take, as to do so would make them less effective.

13493;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;DropboxSupport;@321842 Apologies for the late reply, Allison.
13494;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;DropboxSupport;Essentially, existing Plus users will keep the same features (including permission settings)... 1/3
13495;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;DropboxSupport;@321842 ...for as long as they are customers.
13496;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;DropboxSupport;We made adjustments to new purchases to better match our users' needs.
13497;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;DropboxSupport;This change only... 2/3
13498;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;DropboxSupport;@321842 ...applies to new Plus users (as yourself).
13499;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;DropboxSupport;Regarding the “Settings” page, we’ll flag this with our team, Thanks + hope it helps 🙂 3/3
13500;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;321842;@DropboxSupport Thanks.
13501;7cca4630-e170-437a-9cf0-b612b799df25;321842;Who can I contact to discuss options, including a refund, since I upgraded due to that incorrect advertising?

13890;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;GWRHelp;We'll contact you ASAP.
13891;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;554997;@GWRHelp I was told that it was up to 20 days because of the backlog so which is correct as I'm getting conflicting information.

13893;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;GWRHelp;@554997 That was our aim but it's taking longer for some cases at the moment.
13894;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;GWRHelp;You're welcome to discuss your case with an advisor sooner by calling.
13895;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;554997;@GWRHelp When were you going to inform customers of this?
13896;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;554997;If the 20 days has changed what can I now expect, an extra 2 days,  weeks, months?
13897;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;554997;@GWRHelp ??
13898;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;554997;?
13899;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;GWRHelp;@554997 I will pass on your feedback on this.
13900;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;GWRHelp;At the moment our Customer Support team are focusing on processing claims so we can complete and reply
13901;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;554997;@GWRHelp So back to my original question - when can I expect a response?
13902;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;554997;'As soon as possible' isn't an acceptable time frame.
13903;45e33da1-e1c6-4e3f-bbf7-d947ede77776;GWRHelp;@554997 I'd like to give you a time frame but I can't I'm afraid.

13925;209513ee-9fd2-451c-b564-b81b6c4149ce;204283;@Delta in the fare?

13958;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;Just got a friendly reminder from @VerizonSupport support my bill is due.
13959;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;Also a friendly reminder I should downgrade.
13960;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;I’ve never gotten 1gbps down.
13961;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;Why should I pay for it?
13962;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;VerizonSupport;@286702 Is this for your Verizon residential or Verizon wireless mobile?
13963;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;@VerizonSupport Residential, FiOS.
13964;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;But I’ve had the issue before.
13965;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;Your speed test tool says I do, every other speed test tool says I don’t.
13966;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;VerizonSupport;@286702 We only recognize our speed test site as it was designed to work with our service.
13967;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;VerizonSupport;What speeds are you getting on our site?
13968;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;@VerizonSupport I’ve never gotten less than 988mbps down on your site, even when I very clearly am not getting that.
13969;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;It is an unreliable source, IMO.
13970;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;@VerizonSupport My internet is fine now.
13971;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;It’s just that when I do have real issues, your tools report no problem.
13972;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;It’s very hard for me to gauge/troubleshoot/get help if the prognosis is “we see nothing wrong.”
13973;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;VerizonSupport;@286702 Ok, the main thing is if you were able to directly connect a computer to your router with an ethernet cord and run the test at https://t.co/x8wPeoVW9j we would then see an accurate speed test.

13975;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;@VerizonSupport I really don’t want to seem unreasonable, but none of my computers have ethernet cables and haven’t for like 4 years.
13976;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;@VerizonSupport It’s fine.
13977;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;I am experiencing no issues now.
13978;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;286702;I just want to relay the feedback that make your speed test tool shouldn’t be the end all, be all because it *is* inaccurate sometimes.
13979;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;VerizonSupport;@286702 Any device that is not connected directly to ethernet  and running on Wifi would be susceptible to  interference, which could lower the results.
13980;1ca05bb6-052d-458c-bfb8-39ccc4a96d59;VerizonSupport;Our test shows not only what the device is getting with the interference , it also shows what speeds the router is getting.

14165;3ae17359-23b5-4c63-8cfe-274ac8dc1731;134179;I'd like my money back please.

14288;ba948a90-f17a-4e24-9ab2-9024c2e46954;272978;It was the update from the latest version of 1703 which did this.

14321;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;GooglePlayMusic;Could you restart the device and make sure you're using the most updated version of the Google Play Music app?

14323;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;164397;@GooglePlayMusic Hi there, did that: checked to see if the card was legible, changed it back from internal to SD card, cleared cache and restarted
14324;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;GooglePlayMusic;@164397 Got it.

14328;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;164397;I'm about to uninstall all updates to Google Play Music and reinstall them...
14329;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;GooglePlayMusic;@164397 Thanks for the follow-up info.
14330;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;GooglePlayMusic;"Yes you can uninstall &amp; reinstall the Play Music app updates and then restart your device."
14331;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;GooglePlayMusic;Hope this helps.
14332;24977b99-1c8c-42a4-8320-f05276cdb37d;164397;@GooglePlayMusic Reverting to factory and then reinstalling updates seems to have done the trick.

14338;99ba8930-455a-4572-b2be-f525c0e9c8c3;Ask_Spectrum;@714212 I apologize for the issues with the DVR.
14339;99ba8930-455a-4572-b2be-f525c0e9c8c3;Ask_Spectrum;Are you trying to schedule the recording through the set top box itself or through the app?

14343;99ba8930-455a-4572-b2be-f525c0e9c8c3;Ask_Spectrum;@714212 Would it be okay if I sent refreshed information to the box?
14344;99ba8930-455a-4572-b2be-f525c0e9c8c3;Ask_Spectrum;This would cause it to reboot.

14354;99ba8930-455a-4572-b2be-f525c0e9c8c3;Ask_Spectrum;Sometimes the box reboot can take a while, so if it takes a few minutes, that's totally normal.

14665;11a00ee0-1ea5-41cd-8912-6d6018923e86;AppleSupport;After Scaled, you should see the resolution you want.
14666;11a00ee0-1ea5-41cd-8912-6d6018923e86;275675;@AppleSupport In Scaled I can set the following resolutions: 1024x640, 1280x800, 1440x900, 1680x1050.

14695;2a6b53cf-6c64-49d6-b3ba-dc88e1740e84;641108;It's disgusting to pay for club and be served a wrapped sandwich on a plate.

14719;1a3d61b0-9043-416d-b067-d67c40b58949;188823;@NikeSupport Yep.
14720;1a3d61b0-9043-416d-b067-d67c40b58949;188823;Used the Nike app to record.

14725;1a3d61b0-9043-416d-b067-d67c40b58949;NikeSupport;@188823 What device, OS, and version of the NRC app are you using?

14732;1a3d61b0-9043-416d-b067-d67c40b58949;188823;@NikeSupport Yes to 11.1 and I used the previous update to 5.10 because I didn’t see the update.
14733;1a3d61b0-9043-416d-b067-d67c40b58949;NikeSupport;@188823 We recommend editing your run to match the duration it should be.

15171;00408e48-024a-4c00-99d4-87943993338b;sainsburys;@138425 Hi there, is this the product you're looking for: https://t.co/ebQK9bJfJy?
15172;00408e48-024a-4c00-99d4-87943993338b;138425;@sainsburys Yes it is.
15173;00408e48-024a-4c00-99d4-87943993338b;138425;Every story we’ve been to, which so far is six stores, not one of them sells them anymore.
15174;00408e48-024a-4c00-99d4-87943993338b;sainsburys;@138425 Can you let me know which store you shop in and I will have a look for you?

15176;00408e48-024a-4c00-99d4-87943993338b;138425;@sainsburys I don’t really see the point in telling you what store as not one of them sell the curry anymore.

15178;00408e48-024a-4c00-99d4-87943993338b;138425;Why?

15748;a7c914f2-15ad-4ee4-a26a-d39536ce36a9;134911;WHEN WILL WE BE NOTIFIED?

15754;a7c914f2-15ad-4ee4-a26a-d39536ce36a9;134911;But what about the pilots...are they scheduled?
15755;a7c914f2-15ad-4ee4-a26a-d39536ce36a9;134911;The answer to that ??
15756;a7c914f2-15ad-4ee4-a26a-d39536ce36a9;134911;in many cases is probably NO.

15932;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;135115;Many a times, people calling me gets message that either phone is switched off or not reachable.
15933;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;135115;But i am always ON and in network.
15934;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;135115;Feel free to call, if you need more details.
15935;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;idea_cares;@135115 Sorry but it was some temporary issue, please observe the network for 7 days and if still the issue continues write us back.
15936;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;idea_cares;@135115 we understand your concern is addressed.
15937;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;idea_cares;Regards Prashant
15938;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;135115;@idea_cares How can somebody understand without providing solution to the issue.
15939;d3caebc3-39ca-40f7-8a04-bdb33fb025df;135115;You are having great assumption power.

15955;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;@AskSeagate Hi!
15956;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;My Samsung M3 portable hard drive is recognised in Disk Management on my Windows 10 laptop but it's not showing up in Windows Explorer for me to access the files and back up to.
15957;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;Any ideas please on what to do?!
15958;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;Thanks in advance.
15959;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;@590826 It may be helpful to see how the drive is partitioned in Disk Management.
15960;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Please share a screenshot of this.
15961;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Did the drive previously work on this Windows 10 laptop?
15962;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Any recent software updates?
15963;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;No secret zone set up for the M3 drive?
15964;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;@AskSeagate Hi!
15965;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;Ok I will do.
15966;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;Sorry, currently away at the moment (helpful I know) but will send a screenshot over when I’m back, thanks!
15967;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;@AskSeagate Hi again!
15968;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;Here is a screenshot of my disk management.
15969;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;I’m pretty sure I have used it since updating to Windows 10.
15970;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;I’m afraid I don’t know what a secret zone is!
15971;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;https://t.co/ueUj33FIIm
15972;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;@590826 It seems that the drive is corrupted.
15973;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Have you tried it on another computer and or with another USB cable?
15974;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Is it detected in Device Manager?
15975;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Is it connected directly to the USB port of your computer?
15976;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;@AskSeagate Oh right!
15977;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;I’m surprised by that as I only use it once every couple of months to back up my computer and have only had it for two years.
15978;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;I’ll try the things you’ve suggested, thanks!
15979;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;If it’s corrupted can I re-format it at all?
15980;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;@AskSeagate It's connected directly to the USB port but still shows in disk management when it's unplugged.
15981;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;Can I do anything else?
15982;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;I don't mind losing everything that's on there.
15983;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;"@590826 Did you ever set up a password protected ""Secret Zone"" using the software that came with your M3?"
15984;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;The drive should disappear from Disk Management if the drive is not installed on a USB port.
15985;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Does Disk 1 show even after a reboot when the M3 drive is not installed?
15986;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Let us know,
15987;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;@AskSeagate No I didn’t.
15988;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;It did disappear, sorry I was getting confused!
15989;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;Disk 1 reappears when I plug the hard drive back in.
15990;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;I think it’s corrupted beyond repair unless you have any other solutions?
15991;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;@590826 Can you initialize the drive by right clicking within the box that indicates the drive is not initialized?
15992;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;If disk cannot be initialized, you can try Diskpart but be careful using this to make sure the correct disk is chosen https://t.co/pxR0XO0m5H Both answers will erase data
15993;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;590826;@AskSeagate I’ve tried the diskpart solution but sadly that won’t let me initialise the drive after that either😩😩.
15994;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;@590826 Given your description, if the drive will not initialize no matter what computer/port is tried, and diskpart also does not work, then the drive may be nonfunctional.
15995;dd6cd9eb-3778-430c-b847-55548a6e7b36;AskSeagate;Check your warranty/return options here https://t.co/qQjhlOwgu1

16009;aac0215c-728d-422a-a4d3-70d97f1b798d;AppleSupport;@445647  Are you sending the Animoji as a sticker or in its normal form?

16013;aac0215c-728d-422a-a4d3-70d97f1b798d;445647;@AppleSupport It is now working.
16014;aac0215c-728d-422a-a4d3-70d97f1b798d;445647;I don’t know why it stopped and sent as sticker and then began to work again.
16015;aac0215c-728d-422a-a4d3-70d97f1b798d;AppleSupport;@445647 That's great news!

16023;a78ae136-89a6-4910-95f1-f91734bd7515;nationalrailenq;@424578 Thank you, this station has both a ticket office and TVMs.
16024;a78ae136-89a6-4910-95f1-f91734bd7515;nationalrailenq;You need to purchase your ticket before boarding a train 1/2
16025;a78ae136-89a6-4910-95f1-f91734bd7515;nationalrailenq;@424578 when possible or the conductor can refuse your railcard or you risk penalty fares.

16032;a78ae136-89a6-4910-95f1-f91734bd7515;424578;@nationalrailenq This morning yes, as the ticket person was nice enough to allow it w/ my railcard but advised me of the changes to card payments etc.

16169;9e7f78cc-15f0-4e2a-aa81-2e084348c41d;471615;The only way to get the musi to resume is to completely force close the app and reopen it

16177;9e7f78cc-15f0-4e2a-aa81-2e084348c41d;471615;@SpotifyCares No, I have to close the app each time I finish talking on a call in order for Spotify to give me the option to play/pause the music again.
16178;9e7f78cc-15f0-4e2a-aa81-2e084348c41d;471615;Otherwise it says it’s playing and the time goes on with no music playing and won’t let me pause it

16353;94e1e4bd-11bf-40cd-a3eb-2622187ec199;AppleSupport;Is it set to back up automatically using Time Machine?

16356;94e1e4bd-11bf-40cd-a3eb-2622187ec199;AppleSupport;@170451 To confirm, it sounds like your MacBook was set up as new, and no data was restored from a backup, correct?
16357;94e1e4bd-11bf-40cd-a3eb-2622187ec199;AppleSupport;Do you recall having enabled FileVault during the initial setup?

16470;d98680de-23ff-4f36-ab34-2069ac36f41c;809087;But not without some struggles.
16471;d98680de-23ff-4f36-ab34-2069ac36f41c;809087;As a weekly rental property, this can't be an ongoing problem and there has to be an easy way for them to solve it.

16479;d98680de-23ff-4f36-ab34-2069ac36f41c;809087;I have to say I am skeptical based on history.

16481;d98680de-23ff-4f36-ab34-2069ac36f41c;809087;Not a good thing.
16482;d98680de-23ff-4f36-ab34-2069ac36f41c;Ask_Spectrum;@809087 I understand.

16563;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;745526;@VerizonSupport Fios is out, I checked for usual basic troubleshooting (router lights, battery on white box, resetting everything) but none have worked
16564;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;745526;@VerizonSupport Checked to see if it was down and apparently not the only one experiencing issues right now.
16565;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;745526;What is going on?
16566;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;VerizonSupport;@745526 Were any lights lit on the battery backup unit?
16567;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;745526;@VerizonSupport I just told you I did all the usual troubleshooting and found nothing out of the ordinary
16568;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;VerizonSupport;@745526 We asked so that we could understand your issue.
16569;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;VerizonSupport;Can you tell us about the lights?
16570;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;745526;"@VerizonSupport ...

16571;963accf7-0176-41bf-ac50-fb0bae36cc02;745526;No other lights are on in the box.

16651;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;741807;@coxhelp any update on restoring cable/internet to Warren RI?
16652;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;741807;2885
16653;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;CoxHelp;@741807 1) from what I understand there is a commercial power outage affecting service.
16654;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;CoxHelp;Once power is restored service should be too.
16655;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;CoxHelp;@741807 2) I understand may residential power customers are also affected.
16656;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;CoxHelp;This may seem an odd question.
16657;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;CoxHelp;Do you have power?

16660;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;741807;We had cable and internet until like 1pm this afternoon too..
16661;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;741807;Which is why I'm puzzled
16662;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;CoxHelp;@741807 1) Our power supplies will maintain service for short power interruptions, so perhaps that's why.
16663;2836f5de-3338-49f6-a3a2-f06a1e6dacad;CoxHelp;I have someone double checking

16820;6a5c5d23-f41a-465f-822d-6e31314e7908;143178;@USCellularCares Of course.

16830;6a5c5d23-f41a-465f-822d-6e31314e7908;143178;Are you saying that our customer service rep lied to us and that we have terrible service in Springfield and Bloomington IL because they’re roaming areas?

16834;6a5c5d23-f41a-465f-822d-6e31314e7908;USCellularCares;@143178 They are different as you can be in an extended area and not roaming sometimes.

16944;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;Could you DM me details on how I could assist you?

16946;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;553030;@comcastcares Is this route going to be faster than being on the phone for over an hour with you guys?
16947;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;@553030 To be honest it’s hard to say when I don’t know what going on.
16948;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;–EK
16949;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;553030;@comcastcares Then why would I waste my time explaining everything again?
16950;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;553030;You guys have been let down after let down
16951;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;@553030 I’m sorry this is the way you feel.
16952;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;If you don’t feel like explaining your concern to me that’s your choice to make, but there is–EK
16953;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;@553030 little I can do without knowing what your issue/concern is.
16954;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;–EK
16955;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;553030;@comcastcares I understand that.
16956;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;553030;"But I’ve spent most of my day on the phone with you guys &amp; gotten nowhere."
16957;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;553030;Starting over via text is pointless
16958;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;@553030 Understood.
16959;5063aebe-78a9-4608-912d-340bbbc299d3;comcastcares;If you end up needing assistance later on feel free to reach out to us, we’re always here for you!

16961;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;After a weekend on the Gulf Coast where I was careful to #leaveonlyfootprints I’m ready to board my @AmericanAir flight in BTR headed for DFW and on to PHX.
16962;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;Amazing girlfriend getaway!

16964;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;AmericanAir;@508944 It looks like you had fun, we know we would.
16965;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;AmericanAir;Now it's time for a quick and awesome ride in the skies!
16966;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;@AmericanAir Well except for the mechanical delay that leaves me here in the airport now until noon and missing my PHX flight.
16967;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;#bummer way to end a perfect weekend
16968;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;AmericanAir;@508944 Oh darn, our apologies.
16969;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;AmericanAir;We'll get you going as fast as we can.
16970;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;@AmericanAir Leaving BTR finally.
16971;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;Hoping I can make an earlier flight out of DFW.
16972;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;I’ve missed my original flight.
16973;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;But got some work done so all was not lost!
16974;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;Friendly ground staff at BTR today American!
16975;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;That always helps!
16976;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;Woot!
16977;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;AmericanAir;@508944 We'll have you in DFW before you know it!
16978;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;AmericanAir;Please check with our airport team when you arrive for standby on an earlier flight to PHX.
16979;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;@AmericanAir I opted for lunch in the lounge rather than running to the flight that was leaving.
16980;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;Travel is an adventure!
16981;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;The hummus in the lounge was calling!
16982;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;508944;Hopefully PHX bound in an hour!
16983;a5680fd1-c3b2-4d1e-9d70-8d7faf7caada;AmericanAir;@508944 We understand and have our #wingscrossed for you!
16984;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;@British_Airways Good morning.
16985;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;When did your policy on carrying guitars on board change?
16986;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;@451309 Hi Antonio, what part of our policy for travelling with a musical instrument are you referring to?
16987;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;^L
16988;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;@British_Airways That guitars must be in a hard case and checked into the hold.
16989;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;I was informed at check in.
16990;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;I wish I’d been informed before travelling.
16991;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;@451309 Hi Antonio, did you contact us before travelling to let us know you would be carrying a guitar on your travels?
16992;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;We're sorry for any
16993;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;@451309 inconvenience this has caused you.
16994;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;We will try and make room in the cabin when possible but this cannot be guaranteed.
16995;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;2/2 ^L
16996;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;@British_Airways Well, it’s just never been policy before — as far as I know — that guitars are outright not permitted in the cabin.
16997;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;1/4
16998;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;@British_Airways If I bring a guitar in a soft case (so that it can be stowed in an overhead) and it is checked, there’s a high damage risk in the hold 2/4
16999;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;@British_Airways But if I bring a guitar in a hard case, it’s definitely going to get checked into the hold — so then I risk damage from baggage handling 3/4
17000;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;@British_Airways It’s a catch 22, and it makes me worry if I can travel on BA with a guitar for work, as I need the instrument intact at the other end 😕 4/4
17001;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;@451309 Hi Antonio, we understand your concerns.
17002;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;As previously advised, we will try and allow it to be stored in the cabin but it cannot
17003;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;@451309 be guaranteed.
17004;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;We've passed on your comments for consideration next time this policy is reviewed.

17006;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;@British_Airways Thanks.
17007;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;451309;I’ve been on E170s where the ground crew have said, “The flight’s full, no way it’ll fit”, then there’s been a dozen empty overheads
17008;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;@451309 Hi Antonio, this is disappointing to hear.
17009;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;We understand how important it is to keep musical instruments safe during travel and we'll
17010;e8228ec8-d84d-44e2-9bd6-0c5ca85eb1bc;British_Airways;@451309 do all we can to make sure all our staff are fully trained on this this and understand when to make allowances.

17029;7852e47f-2619-406d-a21e-043cb970d0ac;284951;@ArgosHelpers Sure will do that now.
17030;7852e47f-2619-406d-a21e-043cb970d0ac;284951;@116245 It's false advertising to not have a product available nationwide but to leave it on the website as available.
17031;7852e47f-2619-406d-a21e-043cb970d0ac;284951;Pathetic.

17051;d0b9f348-7b71-41b1-bce2-b0a08919641b;340448;@VirginAtlantic I paid with points.
17052;d0b9f348-7b71-41b1-bce2-b0a08919641b;340448;It doesn't let me check in even.
17053;d0b9f348-7b71-41b1-bce2-b0a08919641b;VirginAtlantic;@340448 When paying with points, you should still have a confirmation that totals the taxes you have paid.

17059;d0b9f348-7b71-41b1-bce2-b0a08919641b;VirginAtlantic;In honesty this isn't something we can alter here so you will need to check in at the airport.

17132;57a6ee14-cae0-4bc2-bfab-7422c798d43f;467756;@ArgosHelpers The two burly delivery guys said they don't take upstairs
17133;57a6ee14-cae0-4bc2-bfab-7422c798d43f;ArgosHelpers;@467756 It is discretion if they decide to take the items upstairs as they are not insured to do so.

17135;57a6ee14-cae0-4bc2-bfab-7422c798d43f;467756;@ArgosHelpers So why does the website say to a room of your choice?
17136;57a6ee14-cae0-4bc2-bfab-7422c798d43f;467756;I think it's pretty obvious that a double bed would be going to a bedroom upstairs?
17137;57a6ee14-cae0-4bc2-bfab-7422c798d43f;467756;@ArgosHelpers It's very misleading
17138;57a6ee14-cae0-4bc2-bfab-7422c798d43f;ArgosHelpers;@467756 I'm sorry about that as we do try to get all items to the room of choice unless the staff have any health and safety is a concerns.- Scott

17334;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;243908;When that happens the Start button isn't working any more.

17337;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;MicrosoftHelps;Let's work on this.
17338;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;MicrosoftHelps;Which version of Windows do you have?
17339;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;MicrosoftHelps;Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue?
17340;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;MicrosoftHelps;Can you also send a short video clip of the actual issue?

17344;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;243908;@MicrosoftHelps Only thing I did see and might have something to do with this (or not) is a white stripe of 1 pixel on the sides of for instance firefox on full screen and sometimes vlc player disappears in the upper left corner instead of going full screen.
17345;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;243908;Can't reproduce that at the moment
17346;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;243908;@MicrosoftHelps Clicking on restart does not solve the problem.
17347;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;243908;I really have to freshly restart the computer when this happens in order to get the Start button functioning again.
17348;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;243908;That makes it annoying when after a restart it turns out that it did not really restart.
17349;fdfcbe5b-8dea-4919-8f52-7a3cd434a39e;243908;Now it's working of course

17583;e378c7eb-1069-4a5f-8aea-98d9e1ce89f7;Tesco;:) - Alisha.
17584;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;So my @115817 MyChoice scheduled delivery for November 2 didn't arrived, and was rescheduled to November 3 by EOD.
17585;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;I spent the day waiting.
17586;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;1/
17587;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;@115817 At 8:00 p.m.
17588;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;I got an email from @115817 saying that MyChoice scheduled delivery was now rescheduled to Monday.
17589;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;No explanation, of course.
17590;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;2/
17591;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;@115817 (Note of course that I lost a day and a half of paid time off for that) 3/
17592;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;@115817 So today I head home again to wait, nothing.
17593;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;"Around 5 I get email from @115817 saying they tried to deliver but ""the business was closed""!"
17594;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;3/
17595;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;@115817 I'm not a business, my doorbell works, I was awake, door not even locked #canada.
17596;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;I called, they said I'd hear back by 7 pm.
17597;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;4/
17598;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;@115817 To their credit a guy did just show up, but asked for help carrying the 140 lb box up the stairs?
17599;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;Good thing I've been going to the gym?
17600;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;@115817 In conclusion, next time a business tries to ship me something with @115817, I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
17601;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;@115817 Oh, and the drivers aren't given phones so can't contact customers with any kind of update or ETA?
17602;838ede24-cd2e-4038-8af1-8791183138e1;461795;That is terrible.

17840;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;Do you know where the battery backup is?
17841;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;@VerizonSupport Yes, in my crawl space
17842;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;@VerizonSupport Yes in my crawl space.
17843;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;@633628 Great, it may be a poor coax connection at your main splitter impacting the signal.
17844;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;Can you locate your main coax splitter?

17846;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;@VerizonSupport everything is tight.
17847;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;Inside and outside
17848;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;@633628 Apologies, reseat the connections as the copper may have developed some oxidation causing a poor connection.
17849;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;Reseating can resolve.

17851;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;@VerizonSupport At the splitter?
17852;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;"@VerizonSupport Tv also says ""inial download in progress, it takes a couple of minutes"" however it has been 2 hours."
17853;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;@633628 Yes, at the main splitter.
17854;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;Once you reseat the connections reboot the one that is downloading.
17855;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;^JRA
17856;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;@VerizonSupport Ok, will try.
17857;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;633628;Not hopeful.
17858;2fcb0f51-8cda-4ac9-ae21-e1f91c151ed3;VerizonSupport;@633628 If you still have the trouble after reseating the coax connections follow us and send a DM.

17869;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;@AmazonHelp Yes I’m a prime member paying for the service and the delivery driver always lies and says delivery attempted.
17870;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;He says it’s because Amazon fine him for delivering late so it’s better for him to say he tried to deliver when he can’t get round enough addresses.

17873;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;No delivery attempted.
17874;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;I needthe delivery for tomorrow and now it’s not here and amazon/their delivery partner is fibbing about trying to deliver.
17875;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;This has happened 8 times.
17876;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;You offered £5 credit, its cost me more than that in phone calls.

17880;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;@AmazonHelp Done.
17881;75c71a6b-2e95-4344-ab78-868fd5b18ca9;248256;Don’t want to be told “we will do everything to make it not happen again” as that has been proven to be rubbish

17919;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;This is why I never update.

17921;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;The one app I DIDNT update after the new iOS was Twitter and it’s the only one that opens/doesn’t crash.

17923;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;AppleSupport;@410910 Let's help take a closer look.
17924;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;AppleSupport;Does this seem to persist after rebooting the device?
17925;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;AppleSupport;Which apps are most in use when you experience these issues?
17926;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;AppleSupport;Are all your apps up to date in the App Store?
17927;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;@AppleSupport Happens mostly in FB and instagram.
17928;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;Installed and updated everything last night.

17930;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;AppleSupport;@410910 Understood!
17931;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;AppleSupport;Let's see if we can delete and reinstall both FaceBook and Instagram to see if the issues persist: https://t.co/bNH7gNvF9e Let us know the results once completed.
17932;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;@AppleSupport Sounds good in theory, but I don't think that's the issue.
17933;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;I just tried to open several apps that I updated last night (insta, snapchat, linkedin, tumblr, Fb, theScore) and all of them locked up.
17934;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;They all freeze, and *sometimes* eventually work.
17935;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;@AppleSupport However, it tends to crash mostly when I open it, it loads, I go back to main menu, and then try to go back in.
17936;0c810744-a5a7-4e74-9694-10fcad89407c;410910;With every app.

18000;8f382fdc-5d29-40a3-b9c7-a04e524da9b8;444595;Clear cache/cookies and it continues to crash in chrome.
18001;8f382fdc-5d29-40a3-b9c7-a04e524da9b8;SpotifyCares;@444595 Can you try using an incognito window?
18002;8f382fdc-5d29-40a3-b9c7-a04e524da9b8;SpotifyCares;Could you also ask your work IT if they've put up some restrictions that might block Spotify?

18005;8f382fdc-5d29-40a3-b9c7-a04e524da9b8;444595;And now it has randomly resolved itself again.
18006;8f382fdc-5d29-40a3-b9c7-a04e524da9b8;444595;I’ll try incognito next time it does it, but I know someone that this happened to in another country the other day.
18007;8f382fdc-5d29-40a3-b9c7-a04e524da9b8;SpotifyCares;@444595 Sounds like a plan.

18009;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;@JetBlue, asking your passengers to stand in this line that wraps around out of sight to get to the train for the terminal at Orlando is unconscionable.
18010;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;You need to fix this with buses or something ASAP.
18011;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;It left a very bad taste in my mouth after a long trip.

18013;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;JetBlue;@503116 We understand that waiting in line after a long flight is not ideal, Maia.
18014;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;JetBlue;But the 'trains’ between the Main Terminal and Gates 1-59 are currently being installed to replace the old ones.

18016;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;@JetBlue I understand WHY they are being replaced and I understand it is the responsibility of the airport, but it is more than just not ideal.
18017;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;Traveling during the holidays is stressful enough.
18018;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;Being ok with cutting capacity in half is very disappointing.
18019;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;@JetBlue Is anything being done at all to ameliorate the issue?
18020;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;Or is it just a “too bad, so sad, not our problem” situation?
18021;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;JetBlue;@503116 ...that can be put into place in coordination with everyone involved at the airport to help things run smoother.
18022;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;JetBlue;Unfortunately, longer lines are part of the process until the improved product is finished.

18024;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;JetBlue;@503116 Airport renovations are something we look closely at as we understand it will affect how our customers are able to get to and from their flights.
18025;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;JetBlue;We don't look to reduce flights as we know that takes travel options away, but we do look at available options and workarounds... 1/2
18026;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;@JetBlue And what is the workaround that has been put into place for this contingency?
18027;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;"All that is communicated to passengers is ""we only have one shuttle running."""
18028;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;An earlier message also indicated busses might be used.
18029;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;That is all that is obvious to passengers.
18030;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;@JetBlue One might also question the wisdom of making these improvements during the holidays unless absolutely necessary.
18031;510c2a3b-7d86-4855-96a4-723121e13871;503116;Also something not communicated to passengers.

18237;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;XboxSupport;Thanks for reaching out to us.
18238;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;XboxSupport;Can you tell us if you've used the USB cord to connect to your PC?

18240;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;809714;@XboxSupport I’m currently using it.
18241;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;809714;In the app, I click on “Configure” and nothing.
18242;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;XboxSupport;@809714 Typically plugging it in while the app is open should allow it to be used immediately.
18243;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;XboxSupport;Can you try a different USB port?

18245;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;809714;@XboxSupport I have tried all the USB ports on my computer.
18246;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;809714;I suspect the app doesn’t even recognize my controller, as I had to do several uninstalling because I keep getting “connect controller to start” as well
18247;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;XboxSupport;@809714 Are you able to connect a standard controller to your PC by any chance?

18250;8bd327ae-5c14-47ca-9c49-a970972bc67d;XboxSupport;@809714 Have you tried following the steps in the guide to help connect your controller?

18473;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;399616;The issue is popping up again, but this time with Fortnite!
18474;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;399616;Sometimes it downloads a little bit, but sometimes an error code comes up.
18475;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;AskPlayStation;@399616 Hello Dawson.
18476;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;AskPlayStation;That's not god.
18477;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;AskPlayStation;Let's start your PS4 in safe mode and select Restore Default Settings: https://t.co/OOaq76kzAA
18478;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;399616;@AskPlayStation What would restore default settings do to my Playstation?
18479;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;399616;@AskPlayStation I also believe the error code was (CE-40851-8)
18480;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;AskPlayStation;@399616 That process restores the PlayStation 4 to the default factory settings.
18481;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;399616;@AskPlayStation But what will it do to my games and stuff?
18482;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;AskPlayStation;@399616 No worries!
18483;ba8ba9cb-0a25-4592-bfca-0a166a2e339c;AskPlayStation;This safe mode option won't delete you game data.
